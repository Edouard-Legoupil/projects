The project is designed to run for four years through National Execution Modalities, with government sub-contracting WWF to undertake some specific functions. The project will increase the extent of Protected Areas, upgrade key areas to higher status and seek innovative funding mechanisms for the Hot-Spot.  Carbon offers some opportunity for such funding.",
