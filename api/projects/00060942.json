            "description": "Project aims to facilitate access to vocational education and training by both promoting participation in VET as well as building the institutional capacity to support the inclusion of marginalized and socially excluded groups in the VET system. The ultimate aim is to promote coordination on employment and social services across national institutions and between the central and local levels. It further addresses the needs of the targeted disadvantaged groups through the design of employment programmes linked to social services in three selected target municipalities, and building the capacities of local structures to implement such programmes.",
