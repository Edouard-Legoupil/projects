This is a follow-up action of the last two AC strategies\u2019 implementation assessment developed with UNDP assistance. Considering the in-house expertise on anti-corruption within the MoJ and other public institutions concerned, and attempting to encourage national ownership of the strategy elaboration process, the UNDP will limit its involvement to the facilitation of the \u201estakeholders engagement meetings\u201d targeted to defining the priorities of the new AC strategy and to conducting a needs assessment exercise with a comparative analysis approach.",
