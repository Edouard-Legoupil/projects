The project therefore aims to strengthen the capabilities of local governments and restore the basic services and livelihoods in the Shida Kartli region. It will ensure that both IDPs as well as the local population, residing in the most affected areas, benefit from the assistance by addressing immediate needs and priorities as well as targeting disaster management challenges.\r\n\r\nDifferent types of assistance will be provided to facilitate early recovery and transition to sustainable development. It will encompass strengthening of local authorities\u2019 capabilities to provide immediate and comprehensive support to early recovery along with facilitation of the resumption of key livelihoods, service delivery and community security.\r\n\r\nThe project will (1) strengthen capabilities of the local authorities to identify, design and implement early recovery activities as well as deliver better public services to the conflict affected population, apply UNDP\u2019s \u201cEight Point Agenda: Practical, positive outcomes for girls and women in crisis\u201d with particular attention to protection of human rights, strengthening of the rule of law and programme development, and (2) target damaged infrastructure and create income generation opportunities for IDPs by support their settlement and reintegration so as to lay a foundation for sustainable development and disaster risk reduction",

An additional element could be the provision of development assistance to, for example, schools or medical facilities in the South Ossetian villages that contributes to safe access for Georgian farmers to fields on the South Ossetian side of the ABL. This could be especially relevant if it becomes apparent that Georgian farmers would be the primary beneficiaries of a free-access agreement.\n\nAreas where problems have already been reported could be prioritized \u2013 for example, in the vicinity of Kveshi (Georgian controlled) \u2013 Mejvriskhevi (Georgian controlled) \u2013 Ghromi (South Ossetian controlled), all located to the East of the Gori-Tskhinvali road, or in Perevi, east of the ABL.",
