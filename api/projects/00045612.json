A secondary objective is to institutionalize the adoption of EE standards and practices in the commercial and hospital sectors in Morocco. The activities proposed in the project are designed to: (i) remove legal, regulatory and institutional barriers to the adoption of an EE building code; (ii) promote a policy dialog among government agencies, industry professionals and developers/landlords on a national EE building initiative; (iii) develop a clear set of EE standards for new residential constructions; (iv) increase the acceptance of EE standards and practices by industry professionals, developers and landlords; and (v) encourage demonstration projects to demonstrate the efficacy of proposed standards. The project will assist the government of Morocco in launching its national EE initiative and will stimulate public/private partnerships for integrating EE considerations in public and private building construction/renovation programs.",
