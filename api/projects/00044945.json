The activities within this proposal are aimed to increase the operational effectiveness to preserve peace and security in Liberia. At present the Liberia National Police remains significantly institutionally weak in all areas as funding for this project will enable the LNP to tackle and solve some of these critical needs that are crucial to the trainings, operations and performances of police officers. This project will also help the National Police Training Academy fill some of the funding gaps that are critical to the sustenance and viability of the institution. Some of the funding will also be used for the equipping and strengthening of 10 police stations headquarters, with Women and Child Protection (WACP) units.",
