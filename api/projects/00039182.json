Sharing knowledge and building research capacities are the key components of Centre\u2019s work. \r\nSince the Centre establishment in 2003, more than 875 professionals from 64 countries in Europe, North and Central Africa and the Middle East have been trained in HIV surveillance and monitoring and evaluation.\r\nThe Centre is committed to helping countries to develop strategic information to guide a more effective HIV/AIDS response by providing innovative training programmes and technical assistance, as well as developing partnerships and collaborative networks that bring together a wide range of expertise in the field.\r\nThe Centre was established as a Knowledge Hub in 2003 under the framework of the Project \"Capability Strengthening for Improved Utilization of Financial Resources to Fight HIV/AIDS\" and funded by the Deutsche Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ) and WHO EURO. \r\nUNDP has been providing administrative and organisational support to the Centre since 2005.\r\nThe central objective of this project was to support countries in the optimal access to and use of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and other large grants through supporting the development of local technical capacity in launching large-scale responses to HIV/AIDS. The Knowledge Hub was designated the WHO Collaborating Centre for Capacity Building in HIV/AIDS Surveillance in March 2008. \r\nCapacity building and technical assistance to countries to develop effective HIV/AIDS surveillance are main areas of work. \r\nSpecifically, the Knowledge Hub provides 18 different training modules in HIV/AIDS surveillance along with development of new training modules and teaching materials, and consultancies to the countries in development and implementation of HIV/AIDS surveillance.",
