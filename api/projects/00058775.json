            "description": "The unavailability of electricity in the areas of return has been recognized by the Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) authorities as one of the major obstacles hindering the implementation of the state strategy for return as well as Annex VII of the Dayton Peace Agreement. Today there are close to 3,000 households in over 100 municipalities all over BiH where pre war inhabitants had returned to their homes at least five years ago but have been living deprived of electrical power ever since. The plans created in 2008  estimated that the forthcoming years will see the reconstruction of additional 40,000 returnee households out of which 18,300 are situated in the areas without a functional electrical network. The overall financial needs for the re-establishment of the electricity supply in the priority returnee areas are estimated at approximately 40,000,000 KM. To fully deal with the problem this figure would need to be doubled. On the other hand, the current pace of the reconstruction of the electric network is slow. A report issued by the BiH Council of Ministers indicates that if the current tempo is not enhanced some households will need to wait as much as 30 years from now to be connected to a source of electrical supply. UNDP BiH decided to address the problem by providing necessary assistance to the Government.\r\nRestoration of electrical network within Electrification of Areas of Accomplished Return (EAAR) Project  will enable reconnection of at least 220 returnee households. Through the planned implementation, the project will create the basic conditions for sustainable return, ensure an access to the electricity supply, as a basic human right, and socially vulnerable category of returnees will be included in development processes.   \r\nExpected outputs of the project are related to increasing capacities of the municipalities and local development organizations in selected municipalities to plan and implement policies for sustainable local economic development and poverty reduction.",
