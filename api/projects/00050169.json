While chronic water stress does pose a significant threat to human development in many parts of the world, this crisis is largely due to failures in water governance.  Climate change will have a significant impact on regional water resources and will exacerbate the challenges of balancing development and management of water resources for social, economic and environmental benefit in an environment of uncertainty and risk.

The programme objective will be realised through the following five outputs:\r\n1.\tNational strategies for equitable governance of water supply and sanitation developed and implemented\r\n2.\tCooperation on transboundary waters enhanced\r\n3.\tClimate change adaptation policies and measures incorporated into water resources management and provision of water and sanitation services\r\n4.\tGlobal and regional advocacy and collaboration on water governance strengthened\r\n5.\tHuman rights based approach, including gender mainstreaming, addressed in water resources management and water supply and sanitation governance\r\n\r\nThe programme will provide policy support, capacity building and advisory services, and support the development of tools, approaches and knowledge to advocate and advance water governance reform and improved water resources management globally, regionally and at country level.
