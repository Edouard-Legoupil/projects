            "description": "Poverty is today persistent among fishing community in Lebanon. In Lebanon we can count 32 fishermen cooperatives and more than 35 000 fishermen.  These cooperatives are poor and do not have real means to rehabilitate the harbours, help fishermen to improve their skill, acquire knowledge about technology, market, nor utilise an ecosystem-based approach. They need help to upgrade their infrastructure and to find a solution for overfishing. As such the current project aims at supporting the livelihoods of fishermen at a pilot site (Cooperative of Dbayeh) through the following activities:\r\n- Development of an ecotourism strategy for the fisheries sector in Lebanon.\r\n- Pilot project implementaion in Dbayeh fishermen cooperative, including rehabilitation of premises to encourage ecotourism activities and promotion of ecotourism activities.",
