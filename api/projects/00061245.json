            "description": "The cultivation, trafficking, trade and consumption of cannabis in Sierra Leone have proliferated in recent years. It has virtually replacedseriously undermined the food security drive as more and more people realize the plant as more lucrative and quicker to mature than other legitimate crops like rice, yam and cassava. Most of the cultivated cannabis is cultivated for local consumption while more recently it has been dried and packaged for trafficking across the borders into the neighbouring countries of Guinea and Liberia.\r\nThis widespread cultivation and consumption is threatening both agriculture and health, two factors to which immense importance is attached for development and economic viability. As a result, it has appeared as a Priority One issue in our the Government of Sierra Leone\u2019s National Intelligence Requirements for the past couple of years.",
