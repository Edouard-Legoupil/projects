This by strengthening resilience of coastal ecosystems and communities in North Paramaribo/Wanica (Pomona) and Coronie through interventions that strengthen the ecosystem ability to respond to current stresses due to past and current national and international anthropogenic actions as well as stress from increased climatic events and climate change. Foreseen interventions such as mangrove reforestation and improved water management will strengthen ecosystem resilience to maintain if not enhance their coastal protection services and water regulation services.",
