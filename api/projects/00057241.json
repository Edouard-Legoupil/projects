By focusing on both new construction and reconstruction, the project will reach a larger segment of the public building stock. By focusing on design techniques and codes, the project can affect education and healthcare facilities, but also other public buildings.  \r\nIntegrated building design includes: building design that integrates climatic conditions, the capture and the conservation of the free solar and internal gains, the efficient and comprehensive reduction of all heat losses through walls and ventilation, the accurate control of all external energy introduced for providing thermal comfort, light, and hot water, and \u2013 last but not least \u2013 user awareness of a new behaviours regarding energy use and good operations and maintenance practices.\r\nThe proposed full-sized project will promote energy efficiency of on-going and future state-funded construction and renovation programmes in Uzbekistan by revising building norms and standards, building capacity of relevant government authorities and energy managers, and showcasing integrated building design approach through project demonstration sites. The project will include five activity results targeting both new and renovated buildings as follows: Activity Result 1 will strengthen norms and regulations applicable to both new and re-constructed buildings, \u201cbuilding in\u201d efficiency into design; Activity Result 2 will establish a highly-visible energy management system in all targeted public sector buildings; Activity Results 3 will build the capacities of building sector to meet more stringent energy performance requirements for all buildings, both on the design side and the construction technologies side; Activity Result 4 will demonstrate the concept of integrated building design in two new and six re-constructed buildings; and Activity Result 5 will integrate the results of the project into standard practice in the public sector and share results with the residential and commercial sectors.",
