It will update and strengthen information provided regarding national circumstances, inventories of greenhouse gases, policies and measures undertaken to mitigate climate change, assessments of vulnerability to climate change and steps taken to adapt to climate change, and information on public awareness, education, training, systematic research and observation, and technology transfer. The project will also increase the capacity of experts and institutions in Egypt to produce subsequent National Communications that meet all guidelines established by the CoP and that serve as a source of information for national policies and measures to mitigate and adapt to climate change in key economic and social sectors.",
