The project addresses conservation needs at the landscape level, bringing together the varied key institutional stakeholders. The project capitalizes on the new opportunities offered by a new Forest Policy and Forests Act, which emphasize the need for public-private sector partnerships and community involvement in the management of Forest Protected Areas.

Landscape conservation of coastal forest resources successfully piloted in Kwale District with participation by all stakeholders, and resulting in improved status of key biodiversity values.\r\n\r\n2. The Kwale Forest Landscape Conservation Model is successfully integrated as best practice into Protected Area policy and programmes in all coastal forest landscapes in Kenya.",
