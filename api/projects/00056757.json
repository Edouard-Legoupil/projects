The Joint Programme approach presents a unified work plan and budget, which coordinates inputs from all development partners under a common management arrangement. It seeks to increase aid effectiveness by improving coordination in the delivery of resources, while avoiding duplication and gaps. It also supports national ownership by explicitly aligning development assistance to national priorities. \r\n\r\nThe programme seeks to strengthen the capacities of the National Assembly and its staff to improve the quality of services provided to parliamentarians and their constituents, as well as building the capacities of MPs to exercise the oversight function and to influence policy making in order to enable this institution to fully contribute to a truly participatory and representative democracy. The project has the following outputs. \r\nOutput 1:  Members of the NA and Committee Departments have the necessary skills and capacities to review policy, legislative and budgetary issues and more effectively oversee their implementation\r\nOutput 2: The National Assembly effectively and accurately represents constituents\u2019 interests, needs and expectations.\r\nOutput 3: The National Assembly has Upgraded Parliamentary Support Services.\r\nOutput 4: Technical Assistance and Programme Support Services operational\r\n\"",
