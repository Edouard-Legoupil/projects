The plan includes one individual project, based on size and application and two group projects for smaller enterprises based on application.  The projects non-investment costs for management, awareness and monitoring and investment costs for equipment replacement and retrofit, technical assistance, trials, incremental operating costs and contingencies.  The grant requested is based on maximum allowable costs with threshold limitations applied.  The approved costs include flexibility in application to allow for efficient phaseout within the sector.  Any (unlikely) CFC users in this sector that will be identified at a later stage will be subject to Chile\u2019s ODS phaseout regulations that stipulate phaseout not later than December 31, 2009.  \r\nThe Government will not seek any funding for the foam sector beyond this request.",
