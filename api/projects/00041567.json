The war destroyed roads, electricity, schools, health centers, and water points, and depleted natural resources. \r\n\r\nTo help address these recovery challenges, the European Commission has re-launched its development assistance with a \u20ac 50 million contribution to the Recovery and Rehabilitation Programme (RRP). The RRP is managed by UNDP on behalf of the Government of National Unity and the Government of South Sudan.\r\n\r\nA total of 48 national and international NGOs are working together in ten states across Sudan to build water points, healthcare units, schools, and sanitation systems; design projects that provide families an opportunity to earn an income; improve the local administration\u2019s capability; and respond to priority needs defined by the communities themselves. The specific outcomes of the programme are distributed across three components: capacity building and institutional strengthening, improving livelihoods, and support to basic services.\r\n\r\nThe RRP emphasizes institutional strengthening and capacity building across all project activities. Building capacity includes training teachers, healthcare workers, farmers, and other professionals, in addition to providing equipment and supplies to deliver public services. The RRP has trained government officials in community assessment, budgeting and fiscal management; information management, IT, English literacy, community health, water and sanitation, and public education. The RRP has also strengthened capacity through building and repairing the offices of local government authorities, and repairing roads and other infrastructure. \r\n\r\nThe RRP is working diligently with local communities to improve people's livelihoods by coordinating activities that will help families earn an income, increasing infrastructure and development, and consolidating peace. Through activities such as distributing seeds and tools, building infrastructure, and hosting skills training seminars and workshops, the RRP is directly empowering the community members in improving their own livelihoods for the long-term. The RRP has trained artisans in furniture carpentry, tailoring, bicycle repair, handicrafts, and business skills. The RRP has built vocational centers, hosted adult education and English literacy courses, established small loan schemes, improved market infrastructure, built grind mills, and provided equipment. \r\n\r\nThe RRP is working diligently with local communities to improve people's livelihoods by coordinating activities that will help families earn an income, increasing infrastructure and development, and consolidating peace.
