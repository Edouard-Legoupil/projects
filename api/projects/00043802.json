The project will also support the development of hydrogen and fuel cell vehicles(FCV) related value chain while enhance scientific, technical, and industrial capacity for commercializing FCBs; and increase the understanding of FCVs and clean vehicles among government, academics, investers, media, and other key actors. Finally, a series of activities will focus on defining a detailed strategy for large-scale FCB commercialization in China. Other capacity building activities will also include expanding government policies, technical standards, enhancing domestic research and development capabilities to support FCB commercialization in China.",
