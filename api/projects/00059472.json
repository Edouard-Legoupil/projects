As such the TRAALOG will have two specific objectives: 1) The provision of technical assistance to specific UNDP Country Offices designed to support expanded and more focused anti-corruption programming at the local level: and 2) The development of technical assistance packages and tools designed to enable local governments to operationalize the principles of transparency and accountability by undertaking specific institutional strengthening efforts.",
