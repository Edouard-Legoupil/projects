This will be achieved through: 1) Improved legal and administrative framework to facilitate the social inclusion of vulnerable target groups (i.e. convicts and former convicts); 2. Improved institutional and human capacities conducive to social ex-convicts re-insertion; 3) Improved society awareness  towards the need and importance of reintegration of former convicts.",
