            "description": "The energy sector in Lebanon faces great challenges from both the supply side and demand side.  At present, the Government of Lebanon is subsidising huge deficits in the electricity sector which further stresses an already high public debt.  The proposed sustainable energy programme aims at supporting the Government of Lebanon demand-side energy management which would decrease its fiscal burden and shift the national market towards increased energy efficiency and small-scale renewable energy applications.  The national capacities and policy formulations are supported and strengthened to reach sustainable energy strategy for Lebanon.",
