            "description": "This full-size UNDP/GEF project aims to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions through the promotion of sustainable urban passenger transportation in the venue cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Thus the project will also contribute to climate stabilization by reducing or avoiding CO2 emissions in the order of 423,000 tonnes of CO2 (over a 10-year period). The indirect CO2 emission reduction due to replication is an estimated 2 million tCO2 -equiv over a ten year period The project will contribute to increasing use of sustainable transport modes by increasing the annual number of person trips on sustainable transport modes promoted under the project by 20%. The legacy of apartheid in South Africa has resulted in a dispersed pattern of land use, with lower-income residents living far from the town centres and other employment nodes in either townships or ex-homelands. On the other hand, it created excellent urban road networks, especially to serve the wealthier suburbs. The combination of these two factors has created a powerful momentum for increasing car use by middle and higher-income groups. As incomes amongst all races rise in South Africa, private car use is anticipated to likewise rise.",
