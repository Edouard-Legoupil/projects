The project is set up as a sub-practice platform and vehicle, spanning across the whole human rights and justice sector, to provide high quality services to UNDP country offices, government counterparts and other clients. The project will build on the experience gained thus far and capacities developed in the area of human rights and justice and further promote East-East transfer of knowledge and best practices thus contributing to policy change and development impact. The project will support catalytic initiatives which will trigger action at the national level by country offices and government counterparts.

In the area of access to justice the justice assessments supported by the project will develop capacity response strategies which will be a basis for justice reform at the national level. By enhancing the capacity of National Human Rights Institutions at the national level, the institutions will be better equipped to carry out its mandate, which includes the provision of a redress mechanism which has frequently been utilized by vulnerable groups. The project will support the further development of internal capacity in the area of the human rights based approach to ensure that UNDP programmes and projects are furthering the promotion and protection of human rights in all sectors.",
