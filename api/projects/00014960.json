The second area is the one related to the support to legislators, national staff, civil servants and legal experts to perform their functions. Furthermore the project aims at enhancing the oversight capacity of the Parliament by improving internal capabilities. Finally, the project aims at strengthening inter-parliamentary relations with Portugese speaking countries and Pacific regiona countries.",
