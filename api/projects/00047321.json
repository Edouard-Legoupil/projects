UNDP Iraq has been nominated as the Principle Recipient (PR) for the GFATM Tuberculosis (TB) grant approved late in 2006 to Iraq.  UNDP and the GAFTM have signed grant agreement number IRQ-607-G01-T effective 15th November 2007 till 30th September 2011 with total amount of US$ 14,500,157 of which US$ 11,445,495 were disbursed by the GFATM to UNDP by 1st October 2010, UNDP Project ID: 56801 TB.  UNDP Iraq has also been nominated as PR for the TB grant approved to Iraq under 9th round of GFATM call for proposals. The GFATM modified their funding architecture through consolidation of different overlapping grants for the same disease component. Hence in October 2010, UNDP and the GAFTM has signed a consolidated grant agreement, merging the remaining of grant agreement number IRQ-607-G01-T and the new grant approved under round 9. This project document is prepared to reflect the changes to the original project document approved entitled \u201cStrengthening TB control in Iraq particularly among poor and vulnerable populations\u201d for the project 56801.  As a result of the consolidation of the two grants, the first grant activities should be closed by 30th September 2010, new consolidated grant activities to start from 1st October 2010 till 31st December 2012. Most of the activities initially planned for the last quarter of 2010 under the consolidated agreement need to be implemented in 2011 since the first disbursement under the SSF agreement was disbursed late in December 2010. In addition this project document will support the national HIV/AIDS control program through support to the development of 5 years national strategic plan and resources mobilization efforts from the GFATM and other potential donors.",
