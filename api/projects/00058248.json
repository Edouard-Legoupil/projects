The expected results of the project intervention include (i) establishment of long term planning mechanisms that will address the most pressing CC risks in Mozambique; a suite of sector specific risk and vulnerability assessments will leverage recognition of the CC threat in sectors not yet fully aware of the potential impact and costs; (ii) strengthened CCA leadership and institutional frameworks are in place to manage CC risks and opportunities; a key element is the agreement to the long-term CCA institutional arrangements needed to effectively coordinate CCA investments in the future; (iii) An enhanced CCA policy framework will be implemented, include climate resilient policies and measures in priority sectors, incl. health, fisheries and gender; small scale pilot adaptation projects especially on the community level will generate lessons learnt on successful adaptation in Mozambique; (iv) National adaptation financing options are established, positioned a CCA capacitated Ministry of Finance as a lead institution; (v) an effective management system and dissemination of CC knowledge are effected; targeted communication and awareness actions reaching out to the community level and the public, as well as targeting high-level decision makers are implemented. The focus of the project is capacity building of beneficiaries from government (especially national and provincial), development partners including NGOs, industry, students, civil society and communities. Capacity building is expected to enhance skills in leadership, management, planning and budgeting skills amongst the technical ministries on how to utilize/integrate recommendations in CC research studies in their planning, budgeting and implementation strategies and develop market/fiscal/financial mechanisms that can deliver integrated CC investment plans and formulation of climate resilient policies in priority sectors. At community level pilot measures will develop guidelines and tool kits on how to climate change proof gender  dynamics, health and fisheries sectors. Adaptation benefits will include: community coping mechanisms to climate change piloted, enhanced national and provincial level CC risk and opportunity management, reduced socio-economic impacts of climate change risks to all sectors.\r\nThe following outputs are expected to be achieved:\r\n- Dynamic, long-term planning mechanisms to cope with the inherent uncertainties of climate change in Mozambique strengthened.\r\n- Leadership and institutional frameworks to manage cilmate change risks and opportunities harmonised, coordinated and strengthened.\r\n- Climate-resilient policies and measures implemented in priority sectors and through demonstration projects.\r\n- Financing options to meet national adaptation costs expanded at the provincial and national level, and integrated into sectors.\r\n- Knowledge on adjusting national and development processes to fully incorporate climate change risks and opportunities generated and shared, including through an advocacy strategy.",
