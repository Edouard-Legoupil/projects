Micro finance institutions will be selected for provision of micro credit while selected Business Advisory Centres will provide capacity development for micro businesses. This two-tier approach will increase access of micro businesses to finance and ultimately have a positive developmental impact on the targeted vulnerable population in the regions. \nFurthermore the project will ensure transparent and conditional provision of grants to the MFIs and closely monitor implementation to ensure the targeted clients are served.  \nThe project is 100% funded by European Commission and implemented by UNDP.",
