Continued post-conflict peace and security, political stability and macro-economic management that have been conducive to growth and development have highlighted this. Political and economic reforms in the country are allowing for an ever-increasing role for the sub-national levels in policy development and implementation. This process, however, needs to be accompanied by a transfer of resources (fiscal decentralization), which can guarantee greater decision-making power at the province, district and municipal levels. This would contribute substantially to the strengthening of planning, monitoring and evaluation systems and processes using both quantitative and qualitative methodologies. \r\nIn mid 2006, the government approved its four-year poverty reduction strategy (PARPA II), which is based on its 5-year development plan and the MDGs. The PARPA II has an action plan and monitoring system, which is currently used by donors to determine the levels of funding, committed to government programmes and to the General Budget Support (which currently represents about 30% of donor aid). This also includes representatives from civil society at both central and local levels. In addition to the Government\u2019s regular annual monitoring process (\u2018Balan\u00e7o do PES\u2019) and the joint government-civil society national and provincial Poverty Observatories, which were successfully introduced during PARPA I, Mozambique has also joined the African Peer Review Mechanism and is now putting in place the necessary mechanisms to operationalise it. \r\nThrough this AWP, two objectives are to be achieved.  First it will contribute to building capacities of the TVM to provide to the public latest development information in Mozambique.  Second, it will allow TVM to effectively cover the development projects (supported by UNDP).  It will support TVM\u2019s activities to participate in development-related workshops, acquire necessary equipment and supplies, and travel to provinces to cover development projects for the Polos de Desenvolvimento and Ver Mo\u00e7ambique programmes, for the attainment of the following outputs:\r\n\r\n\r\n2.2.3 level of public access at district and provincial levels to local government performance information and local services information increased\r\n2.2.4.
