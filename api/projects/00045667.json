Thses DVDs would be broadcasted in mainstream media as a public relations tool and be targerted to such groups as schools, community based groups, faith based groups, private sector companies, and critical agencies (e.g. the Trinidad and Tobago Fire Services; the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service; Regional Corporations).",
