Improved financial and operational sustainability will be demonstrated through pilot co-management strategies in PAs covering 7, 750 km2 (Makgadikgadi/Nxai National Park 7, 500 km2 and Nata Sanctuary, 250 km2). The project is implemented as a component of the Makgadikgadi Pans Integrated Management Plan, which covers an area of ca. 12, 000 km2.
