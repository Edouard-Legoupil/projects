In addition, this project will help strengthen Jordan\u2019s capacity to fulfill its commitments to the UNFCCC on a continuing basis. The structure of this project is based on the country\u2019s previous experience and studies already identified under a stocktaking exercise. The main components of the project are [emphasis on socio-economics, gender-mainstreaming and health]: (a) an inventory of greenhouse gases for the base year 2006 and time series 2000-2005; (b) an analysis of recommended measures to mitigate the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Jordan, with emphasis on the energy/transport, industrial, waste, solvent, and LULUCF sectors; (c) an assessment of the vulnerability Jordan\u2019s water, health, and agriculture sectors to climate change, in conjunction with the ability of each sector to adapt; (d) preparation of the Third National Communication of Jordan and submission to the Conference of the Parties (COP). In addition, socio-economic, gender-mainstreaming and health adaptation scenarios, as well as public awareness activities and stakeholder consultations will be cross-cutting along the overall course of this project. Therefore, the preparation of the Third National Communication is expected to enhance general awareness and knowledge on climate change-related issues in Jordan, and to aid in the process of national planning and policy.",
