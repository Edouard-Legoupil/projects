This is envisaged to be achieved by (i) testing the technical and, in particular, the economic and\r\nfinancial feasibility of selected bioenergy technologies on the basis of new business and financing models, and developing further the financial, institutional and market strategies for their large-scale replication; (ii) supporting the development and adoption\r\nof an enabling policy framework to implement and leverage financing for the recommended strategies; iii) building the capacity of the supply side to market, finance and deliver rural bioenergy services; and iv) institutionalizing the support provided by\r\nthe project to facilitate sustainable growth of the market after the end of the project.",
