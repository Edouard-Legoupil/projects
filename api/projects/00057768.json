The PA-SUZP will have the following three outputs:\r\n\r\n(1) Capacity Development: This component would aim at developing a capacity development framework for the newly formed UZP. Training curricula will be developed covering UZP rules, procedures, functions and innovations. All UZP chairmen, vice-chairmen and members will be trained under this project. \r\n\r\n\r\n(2) Advocacy & Communication: Different communications materials will be developed and disseminated on the role and functions of UZP, so that every body becomes aware of the jurisdiction of UZP. Local, regional and national levels seminars and workshops will be arranged based on research findings. A network of LG leaders may also be promoted for a self-propelling policy advocacy.\r\n\r\n(3) Policy Input: The project intends to help policy planners of the government with appropriate policy inputs generated through various activities such as pilot research, quick appraisal, studies, dialogues and debates.",
