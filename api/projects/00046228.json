The quality of important development data as well as the capacity to analyze and manage such data will be improved. Data will be used to inform policy development and decision making, address millennium development goals and track progress on human development. Existing data collection and maintenance systems and the data themselves, will be examined and strengthened so that the Government will have good quality data for decision making and information from analysis of these data will be used to improve the effectiveness of development planning in the context of Vision 2030 Jamaica - National Development Plan and the Medium Term Socio-Economic Policy Framework. the project will achieve these objectives by Promoting National Development Goals and MDGs in Jamaica through Studies on the Impact of Poverty, Advocacy, Improved Poverty Measurement Tools,  Longitudinal Studies on Quality of Life Indices, and assistance with National Development Plan (Vision 2030) Monitoring and Evaluation. Expected outputs include: \n- Increased capacity for data management and analysis\n- Data systems strengthened to facilitate MTF monitoring\n- Increased data quality for development planning",
