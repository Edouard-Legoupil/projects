Special consideration will be given to initiatives which incorporate cross cutting issues such as Gender, Human Rights, HIV and AIDS and Climate Change. Support may come through the funding of consultancies services, capacity development related measures, pilot and preparatory interventions and activities that strengthen the cooperation and partnership between the Government and UNDP as well as international integration. A strengthened cooperation and focus on the mentioned areas will help to increase the effectiveness of UN development interventions and thus directly support the Government in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).",
