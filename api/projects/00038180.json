The proposed project will establish the desired environment for a long-term market development and set a target for a follow-up BIPV program in the 10th Malaysia Plan. The project will achieve its objectives by: developing and implementing strong financing mechanisms, solid institutional and policy frameworks; extensive education and capacity building campaigns to generate awareness and\r\nimprove local competency; introduction of standards and guidelines, developing and enhancing the market; and upgrading the local industry towards local manufacturing.",
