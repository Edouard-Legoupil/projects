Only a small number of companies have a clearly defined CSR policy and usually the application of this concept is related to ad hoc donations for individuals, civil society organizations and public institutions, but not to sponsorship. Accordingly, internal dimension of CSR, which primarily considers the concern for employees, as well as environmental protection and socially responsible conduct of companies, becomes neglected. Therefore, it is expected and important to consider social responsibility of companies, which declare themselves as being such, by conducting researches and taking into account this dimension of CSR as well.\r\nCommunication and cooperation between companies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) is not at the satisfactory level. According to both parties, a main cause for this situation is lack of confidence. Companies mainly criticize a lack of transparency in the work of NGOs, while NGOs believe that companies generally do not have enough sensibility for the needs of communities where they conduct their business operations. Furthermore, the examples demonstrate that there are much more implemented partner projects and investments by business sector when public institutions are involved.\r\nThe level of information about the concept of CSR among the mass media is not at a satisfactory level as well.\r\nA key problem for the long-term development of the concept of CSR in Montenegro is lack of involvement of relevant institutions at the national level in the process of creating a favourable environment for development of the concept of CSR . Certain law regulations regarding donations from the companies for the activities of common good are not stimulating enough for the companies in general. Additionally, a government body which would continuously work on promotion and development of the concept of CSR in Montenegro does not exist .\r\nIt is evident that the increase of knowledge and level of information of all sectors in Montenegrin society about the concept of CSR is necessary if we want to overcome the prejudices about each other and to jointly start with intense activities for improvement of living conditions of all members in the Montenegrin society.
