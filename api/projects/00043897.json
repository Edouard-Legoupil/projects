Output 1. Stakeholders strengthen legal and regulatory enabling environment and establish land and water use management basis for maintaining and restoring ecosystem health in the Prespa Lakes. Output 2. Stakeholders modify productive sector resource management practices to reduce pesticide inputs, increase habitat heterogeneity, and improve the status of target species and communities in the Prespa Basin. Output 3. Stakeholders conserve priority biological diversity across the Prespa Basin and make key protected areas in Prespa Basin fully operational.  Output 4. Stakeholders build upon ongoing cooperation by strengthening the transboundary coordination mechanisms.",
