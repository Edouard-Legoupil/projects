The project focused on emerging recovery challenges in the context of resettlement, including livelihoods restoration and reemployment of the land-loss farmers, conservation of traditional culture and history heritage, access to safe drinking water and promotion of clean energy in the newly built residential buildings, recycling and management of emergency shelters, as well as environment protection in reconstruction, in line with other sustainable solutions and recovery actions. The project received great support from both central and local governments. At the supervision of the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD), the project is implemented with the technical support of the China Academy of Urban Planning and Design (CAUPD), and US$ 0.8 million were provided by the Government of Beichuan as cost-sharing funds.",
