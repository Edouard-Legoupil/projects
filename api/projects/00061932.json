            "description": "Expected CP Outcome: National institutions and other key stakeholders are coherently and effectively addressing Climate Change (CC) adaptation and mitigation and Ozone layer protection\nIndonesia faces challenges in relations to rapid deforestation, peat-soil degradations and other forms of land-use change that has potential to release carbon stored in existing and converted forest areas. Indonesia must also address potential impacts of projected contributions from greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions to climate change). The rapid increase of fossil fuel consumption (over 6% per year) also contributes to climate change, and in this sense Indonesia must consider both mitigation and adaptation aspects\nConsidering challenges through this Project Initiation Plan (PIP), UNDP will support the government in addressing the needs and priorities of Indonesia by working closely with relevant responsible party (-ies) to develop six new proposals on (1) low emission on degraded land (biochar); (2) greenhouse gases inventory (third national communications); (3) green commodities (sustainable palm oil); (4) cross protocol cooperation on emission reduction (climate benefits in Air Conditioner and refrigeration systems); (5) climate change adaptation and risk management (Climate Risk Management or CRM); and (6) private sector climate change financing initiatives.",
