The project will be targeting the cultivated areas in the Gaza Strip, where the large portion of the population depends on the agricultural activities in making their living. The project will be carried out to the maximum extent possible by labor-intensive methods, responding to the urgent need for employment opportunities. It is estimated that the project will allow for the creation of approximately 44,829 workdays for poor unemployed workers from the targeted areas. The project will mainly focus on rehabilitating and reconstructing the destroyed water wells and greenhouses.",
