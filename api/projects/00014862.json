During the one year inception phase, CRP successfully established collaborative relationships with key partners and stakeholders engaged in peace building and recovery in the state and leveraged these to provide timely, effective support in capacity building, conflict resolution initiatives and peace dividend to its primary implementing partner, the Reconciliation and Peaceful Co-existence Mechanism (RPCM). Notably, all peace agreements achieved with CRP support continue to hold.  UNDP approached the inception phase as a pilot and contributed meaningfully to peace building efforts in the state simultaneous to refining its implementation modalities and capturing lessons learned for scaled-up application in all the Three Protocol Areas over the coming two-year period",
