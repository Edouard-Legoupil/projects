It is blessed by its various tourist attractions, especially important for religious tourism, such as Mount Nebo, Siyagha and Al Mkhayat, which attract tourists from all over the world.  Al Faisaliyeh is characterized by its moderate climate with visibly healthy plant cover and forest trees, especially in its western side, whereas the eastern, northern and southern parts are characterized by growing legumes, cereal and stone fruit trees.  The area hosts several water springs (Musa Spring, Al Jadid Spring, and Al Kaneesa Spring).  All this has contributed to making the area primarily agricultural.
