The project will have a direct impact on the livelihood of at least 1,250 households within 5 communities affected by the July 2006 conflict through extending the areas suitable for agriculture, and will provide direct assistance to the farmers in the area.  The project will support the establishment of Water Users Association for proper management of water use, will produce topo-cadastral maps which are the bases for designing the irrigation distribution networks, will establish a land classification database as a prerequisite for the development of the hydrant implementation plans, and will execute land reclamation for an area of 522 ha setting up the infrastructure for the water distribution network.",
