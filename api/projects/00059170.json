Mine clearance operations will be conducted by demining organizations under supervision of the Tajikistan Mine Action Centre. Management capacities of the Centre will be strengthened and demining operational capacity will be increased by integrating manual, mechanical and animal detection technologies. Support to mine victims and survivors will be provided to ensure access to adequate medical rehabilitation, psycho-social support services as well as to socio-economic assistance. Mine risk education will be provided to all mine-affected communities and groups. Mine action aims at eliminating the negative humanitarian impact of landmine contamination and at supporting socio-economic development and poverty reduction in the mine-affected regions.",
