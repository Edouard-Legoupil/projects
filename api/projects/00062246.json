            "description": "The  Agricultural sector  still  faces a daunting set of challenges, the most important of which are listed in the Development Strategy and Investment Plan( DSIP) and include;  low productivity due to antiquated farming methods, difficulty in   accessing productive assets including land, weak processing, marketing, storage and distribution systems etc. In addition, market access and growth potential for a number of products are constrained by low purchasing power in producing areas, weak market chains, inadequate economies of scale and difficulties in linking SMEs with market off-takers. This project will aim to address most of the above mentioned challenges through contributing to the government\u2019s DSIP\u2019s Programme 2 \u201cMarket Access and Value Addition\u201d. Through building on inclusive business approaches, the implementation strategy involves adoption of a business linkage approach. Project interventions will involve engaging/linking buyers to farmer groups, provisions of customized business development services, strengthening cooperatives and farmer groups, providing customized agricultural services support, and introduction of innovative financing products and appropriate technologies.",
