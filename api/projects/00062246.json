This project will aim to address most of the above mentioned challenges through contributing to the government's DSIP's Programme 2 \"Market Access and Value Addition\". Through building on inclusive business approaches, the implementation strategy involves adoption of a business linkage approach. Project interventions will involve engaging/linking buyers to farmer groups, provisions of customized business development services, strengthening cooperatives and farmer groups, providing customized agricultural services support, and introduction of innovative financing products and appropriate technologies.","output_id":"00079650","output_title":"Inclusive Markets- Agric&Trade"}],"project_descr":"Development of inclusive markets in Agriculture and Trade to inform and strengthen business linkages & support associations and institutions","project_id":"00062246","project_title":"Development of inclusive markets in Agriculture&Trade","region_id":"RBA","start":"2011-08-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00062246","lat":"2","lon":"33","name":"Uganda","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
