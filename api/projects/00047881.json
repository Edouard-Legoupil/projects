A unique selling point for Montenegro, consisting of spectacular coastal formations, diverse mountain ranges, scenic routes, wooded forests, rivers and lakes, and dispersed cultural diversity, has not been utilized to its full potential.  The high-season for tourism is considered to last anywhere from six to eight weeks, with an overwhelming majority of tourists focused in the coastal region.  With inadequate infrastructure in place, this fact does not only highlight the underutilization of other parts of the country, but seeks to undermine a sustainable use of natural resources.  In shifting the focus to the north, Montenegro would contribute to economic and social development of its north region, it would create and offer a niche service to a well organized, identified, and large target audience that is also environmentally sensible, it would relieve the population/tourist pressure from the southern region in the six-eight weeks of the high season and thereby balance a seasonal demand, and extend the length of its main, high-season through diversifying its offer. \r\nThe Ministry in charge for tourism has recognized this fact and in its revised Tourism Master Plan, it plans to shift its focus toward the country\u2019s north area.  Consistent with both the objectives and program areas of UNDP Montenegro and the Government of Montenegro, this approach will demonstrate, through area based actions and projects, the economic viability and advantages of sustainable development in North West Montenegro.  The proposal builds on a number of program areas undertaken by UNDP Montenegro and provides a sub-regional focus for the programs of Spatial Planning, the Localization of Sustainable Economic Development, the utilization of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Sustainable Tourism, Biodiversity, and Renewable Energy.  \r\nAs a follow up of this multiannual programme, UNDP CO established partnership with local stakeholders from Montenegro and relevant partners from neighboring countries to work under IPA CBC Component Projects. Two ongoing projects: Development of Outdoor Tourism (MNE-HR) AND Sustainable Tourism for Equal Chances (MNE-SRB), are contributing towards establishing of cross national tourism clusters, including development of new professions, as well as safety standards and capacities strengthening. These cross-border projects will serve as initial points for Dinaric-wide approach, with purpose on establishing of Corridor of Sustainable Development (Via Dinarica/Long Trail). Positive experiences and lessons learned through Hiking&Biking Project in Montenegro will serve as main entry points for regional based development, which should serve for income generating in Dinaric Arc region.",
