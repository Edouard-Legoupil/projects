The idea is to work with eight African artists (one for each MDG), from across the continent, who would together record a song on the 8 MDGs.  This song would be recorded as a music video, which would be screened through the World Cup, across all the Fan Parks and Public Viewing areas. On the day of the finals, all 8 artists would come together to sing the song in a live performance at the Soccer City Fan Fest in Johannesburg.",
