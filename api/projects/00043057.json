This will be sequenced as three consecutive steps: \n\u2022 Step 1 \u2013 individual country assessments (desk studies), TORs and work plans for next steps \n\u2022 Step 2 \u2013 detailed in-country assessments with focus on the design of future projects and interventions, including stakeholder consultations, the development of detailed project proposals ready for submission/approval, as well as partner and resource mobilization. \n\u2022 Step 3 - launching of concrete projects (endorsement, recruitment or procurement), inception, implementation, reporting and monitoring as well as ex-post project evaluation when applicable. \nThe BRC will play an overall facilitation role with a focus on initial assessments and support of activities at national level, and in particular advocacy, knowledge management, building of partnerships and resource mobilisation, while in-depth country assessments, project development and implementation (Phase 2 and 3) in the selected target countries will be the responsibility mainly of country offices.",
