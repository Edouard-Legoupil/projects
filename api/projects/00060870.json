The project activities will develop the capacity of communities in Ninewa to engage in inter-communal dialogue and resolve inter-communal disputes.  To do this, it will identify and train facilitators from a range of geographic areas and communities in the governorate who will be able to lead efforts to reduce the social distance between ethnic, religious and broader communities in Ninewa.  These facilitators will undertake community workshops in local areas to build inter-community understanding and to identify initiatives that communities can undertake themselves to improve inter-community relationships.",
