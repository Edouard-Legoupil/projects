Specifically, the project aims \u201cat contributing to the Government\u2019s efforts to attain MDGs by focusing on localization of the MDGs at the community level thus responding directly to the needs of poor communities\u201d.   The Project intends to achieve this through the adoption of three strategies namely: Participatory Development Management (PDM); Asset Based Community Development (ABCD); and Local-level Integrated Information Systems (LIIS). The project aims at developing working partnerships with other developmental agencies to complement its activities. This includes facilitation of easy access to micro-finance and mainstreaming of gender, HIV/AIDS and environmental concerns such as the impact of climate change.",
