            "description": "There are numerous projects for alleviating economic crisis worldwide, with great resource envelopes and a great reach in terms of beneficiaries. However, the project \u201cLimiting the effect of the economic crisis in the north of Montenegro\u201d \u2013 although relatively small in terms of budget - has had an exceptional impact in the context of the small country of Montenegro; and even more so, when considered in the context of the poor, vulnerable North of the country.\r\n\r\nThe global economic crisis has created an opportunity for Montenegro to address some entrenched, long-term developmental challenges; responding to the immediate effects of the crisis, while at the same time committing to the long-term interventions to create inclusive markets and unleashing the entrepreneurial potential of the region.  \r\n\r\nThe labour market of northern Montenegro is characterised by low activity and employment rates and an unemployment rate approaching 30% . The unemployment rate for women is higher than for men at 32%.  Around two-thirds of the unemployed have been without work for over two years. The health and education indicators are also lower in the north than in the centre and south of the country.   \r\n\r\nThe goal of the project \u201cCrisis mitigation in uncertain times: Conflict prevention through targeted economic development and institutional building\u201d was to support entrepreneurs in five municipalities in the north of Montenegro with good business ideas and support for those who wanted to start their own business, with specific emphasis on women entrepreneurs. The support consisted of trainings, education, grants ranging between \u20ac3,000.00 and 8,000, and networking support.  Unusually, perhaps,  for a development project, priority was not necessarily given to the poorest and most vulnerable, but to those with the best business plans, and the most extensive and inclusive supply chains \u2013 those, in other words, who had the greatest potential to impact on the region\u2019s economy. Priority was given to the entrepreneurs who had business ideas dealing with new technologies and services in tourism industry and organic production, production of souvenirs, new technical solutions for production using the energy efficiency and ideas dealing with usage of renewable sources of energy. \r\n\r\nIn the first phase, UNDP provided technical training on developing an idea into a functioning business plan.  Out of a total of 55 business plans, a commission consisting of representatives of the UNDP, local municipalities, the National Directorate for Development of SMEs and the Business Start-Up Centre (BSC) Bar received and selected the best 12 plans that qualified to receive financial and mentoring support from UNDP. UNDP supported the winning candidates through the official procedure of registering their businesses and obtaining the necessary licenses for the start of operations. The field of expertise for the 12 start ups ranged from production of souvenirs, handicrafts and rafting to organic food production: horticulture, greenhouse production of vegetables and flowers, buying and processing of forest fruits and mushrooms, greenhouse production of organic raspberries and strawberries vertical farming. \r\n\r\nAfter the initial phase where the newly registered companies worked with UNDP and the BSC Bar to develop products and services that would satisfy emerging needs in the market, the businesses are expected to be engaged in marketing and negotiations with potential clients - international tour operators, large supermarkets and hotels.\r\nWould-be entrepreneurs under this project were helped to develop sound business plans, cost-benefit analysis of various business models, cost their plans and orient themselves about additional funding windows, and network with potential business partners and local government.  Priority was given to ideas pertaining to \u201cgreen\u201d jobs which could be linked with local tourism initiatives \u2013 supplying local hotels or businesses, for instance. The empowerment of women was promoted through special support to women entrepreneurs.  While entrepreneurial development initiatives have been attempted in the past, a general weakness has been the long-term support; oftentimes, a new entrepreneur has been able to start, only to see the business come to a halt some months later due to unforeseen problems for which there is no support. \r\n\r\nThe project used 12 start ups as an initial pilot. These men and women have succeeded in starting up successful, small businesses employing between 1 and 15 employees, and with relatively wide reaching networks of suppliers, transportation and storage, hence benefitting others in their communities. The pilots were used as a means of assessing and demonstrating, as part of a larger study, what the business barriers are in Montenegro \u2013 what are the obstacles facing ordinary men and women wishing to start up a business? The study looked at access to credit, legal and bureaucratic barriers, and the provision (or lack thereof) of business development advice and support. Based on this, a regional development strategy has been adopted, incorporating the lessons learned during implementation. A very important point to mention is that this strategy is based on a strategic long-term vision of an energy efficient, sustainable, equitable Montenegro, and has recently become embedded within the law on regional development.  \r\n\r\nImpact indicators will demonstrate, several years from now, what effect these programmes will have had on the economic situation in the North, and on the level of unemployment. It is hoped that the larger vision for the North of the country, one of grass-roots, sustainable tourism and small, green businesses, will be supported by wider ranging initiatives started by local governments, hence starting a cascade effect. Meanwhile, the project has succeeded in leveraging even greater support from other UN Agencies, such as UNIDO, FAO, UNEP, and UNESCO.",
