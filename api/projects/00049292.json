The project objective is to strengthen the policy and regulatory framework for mainstreaming the requirements for conservation of karst and peatland biodiversity into productive sectors (mining, water use) and spatial planning at Cantonal level. The Project will work with Canton 10 Government and its constituent municipalities on the development of a new Cantonal spatial plan. Once this will be developed and approved by the Government, the replication work will target 18 municipalities in 9 more cantons. The elaboration of the spatial plan will include water zoning and SWOT analysis. The project will develop drafts of water use zones at BiH Livanjsko Polje and in Croatia In parallel to the elaboration of the Cantonal spatial plan, the Project will work with the municipalities (primarily Grahovo and Livno) to develop and approve biodiversity rules-of-conduct \u2013 a municipal level policy that would stipulate allowed and prohibited uses of karst field resources and introduce a system of disincentives (fines) for illegal activities such as fires and excessive logging. The project will develop by-laws and methodological guidance on ecologically safe peat-mining, and test it at 750 ha of karst peatlands and promote an international (Croatia-BiH) formal agreement and plan for cross-border water management plan.. The project will support a set of activities to exchange experience and lessons learned with European countries and the GEF.",
