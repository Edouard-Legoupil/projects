By promoting the planting of carbohydrate-rich root and tuber crops, vitamin- and mineral- rich native vegetables and growing protein-rich native chicken in home gardens, the project will link production in home gardens to consumption at the household kitchen. It will also link production in school gardens to consumption in feeding programs of schools and day care centers.",
