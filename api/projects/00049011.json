From these 6 components, the following are the expected outcomes: (a) Enhanced knowledge of potential MCT applications; system benefits, availability and cost,  as well as capacity and capability of local service providers for MCT systems; (b) Increased MCT applications in ICE sectors as well as market share of MCT, with resulting in GHG emission reduction, and reduction in MCT cost by about 25% average; c) Increased investments on MCT: banks/financing institutions providing loans for MCT projects; (d) Approval and implementation of policies supportive of MCT projects; e) Enhanced awareness of the benefits of MCT in order to increase the number of MCT users and planned MCT projects; and, f) Availability of locally made, and enhanced local manufacturing capability of MCT system components.\r\n\r\nComponent 1: Technology Assessment & MCT Application Development  \r\n\u2022  Documented Techno-economic feasibility assessments of local production of MCT components, and potential MCT application projects\r\n\r\nComponent 2: MCT Demonstration& Market Development\r\n\u2022  Documented results of the implemented MCT application demos;\r\n\u2022  Identified and designed other MCT application projects \r\n\r\nComponent 3: Technical Support to MCT Financing\r\n\u2022  Training and promotions for bank/financing institutions;\r\n\u2022  Designed financing schemes for MCT projects.\r\n\r\nComponent 4: Policy & Institutional Support\r\n\u2022  Proposed policy frameworks supportive of MCT application projects.\r\n\r\nComponent 5: MCT Promotion\r\n\u2022 Designed and implemented MCT promotional and advocacy program for the ICE sectors.\r\n\r\nComponent 6: Technical Support for Local MCT Industry\r\n\u2022 Documented results of the capacity building on local production of acceptable quality MCT system components",
