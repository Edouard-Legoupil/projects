Because of the context the budget is expected to catalyse and leverage significantly more resources, yielding a perceptible difference in SEE countries for those with disabilities and marginalised people and communities to access and to use eServices to meet their goals","output_id":"00078470","output_title":"Marginalized Groups","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"Social Inclusion Award-State/entity/municipalities/local development organizations in selected municipalities have increased capacity to plan and implement policies for sustainable, inclusive local economic development and poverty reduction","project_id":"00058680","project_title":"Social Inclusion Award","region_id":[],"start":"2010-09-01","subnational":[]}
