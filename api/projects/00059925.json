            "description": "The Iraq \u2013 Public Sector Modernisation (I-PSM) programme is a Government of Iraq-led UN joint programme supporting Iraq\u2019s Strategic Government Plan (SGP) 2011-14 and its National Development Plan (NDP) 2010-2014. The programme is fully aligned with the UN Development Assistance Framework (UNDAF) 2011-2014. \r\n\r\nThe Programme has four themes: i) developing policy and building machinery at the centre of government for managing Public Sector Modernisation (PSM); ii) piloting reform in three key sectors of health, education and water and sanitation (WATSAN); iii) supporting system-wide reform for gender mainstreaming, e-governance, national statistics and development management; and iv) supporting decentralised service delivery and local governance initiatives.\r\n\r\nThis Phase of the programme builds on lessons learned and recommendations emerging from the implementation and external evaluation of the I-PSM Phase I.  I-PSM Phase I is the foundation for the analytical assessment and preparatory work enabling Government to develop a system-wide public administration reform plan, as well as sector-specific modernisation plans for three pilot sectors and 3 pilot governorates. \r\n\r\nBy focusing on service delivery, the Government can demonstrate to the people of Iraq that public sector modernization has concrete and tangible benefits for the population as a whole. This programme will establish synergies with existing UN programmes aimed at addressing corruption, involve the active participation of civil society, and integrate cross-cutting issues in relation to employment, gender, social inclusion and environment. The programme will coordinate with the public sector reform initiatives of other bilateral and multilateral development partners  and with the two other major UN joint programmes, the Local Area Development Programme (LADP) Phase-II and the Private Sector Development Programme \u2013 Iraq (PSDP-I) to create synergy and avoid duplication.",
