These districts will be identified during the Peace and Development Analysis and membership of the groups will be developed together by UNDP and its local partners.  These groups will be under the chairmanship of each of the District Heads on rotational basis.  The groups will discuss and resolve cross-border issues with the involvement of local experts as needed.  Membership would include District Heads, Heads of municipalities within the districts, experts from relevant fields depending on the issue being discussed, law enforcement structures and representatives of local women groups to ensure some semblance of gender balance.  The principle of gender balance will also be followed whenever possible when selecting participants for membership in the working groups. The Project will continue to work closely with UNDP Tajikistan to identify actors and to create and support the working groups.  The Programme also hopes to establish a similar relationship of cooperation with UNDP Uzbekistan.",
