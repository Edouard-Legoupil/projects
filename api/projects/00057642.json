Research shows that absolute majority of Roma are not formally employed, instead they participate in shadow economy, and 42% of total Roma population are unemployed and has never been employed. Illiteracy rate exceeds the national average by more than 10 times and majority of Roma has not had any professional education. Complicated employment of Roma is also largely influenced by negative attitudes towards Roma demonstrated by employers and society at large. Lithuania is still lacking innovative mechanisms for social inclusion of Roma, therefore, the aim of the project is to develop and test a multifaceted approach for inclusion of Roma into labour market as well as motivating and supporting them in keeping their job positions, elaboration and application of methodologies for participation in the social life. Project will also target employers to promote tolerant attitude towards Roma employees. The value added of the project is based on complexity of services and personalized problem solving.",
