            "description": "The Central Elections Commission \u2013 Palestine is the independent body mandated to administer elections in the Palestinian Territories. Since 2002, and with substantial support and technical assistance from the international community, the CEC has successfully carried out voter registration activities, presidential and legislative elections, in addition to several civic education projects. In moving toward a more self-sustainable and cost-effective CEC, this initiative uses the electoral cycle approach to begin to address the long-term professional development and civic engagement needs of the CEC.  The professional development component will focus on designing and implementing a long-term institution building programme for the CEC and its staff, based on a baseline study. The civic engagement component will focus on systematizing and implementing a comprehensive and targeted programme of engagement with electoral stakeholders that recognizes and meets the needs of the Palestinian community. The current project will be a seed initiative that seeks to begin the professional development of the CEC and promote inclusive participation in electoral and political processes, while designing an overall umbrella programme that would include support to more institutions and processes over time.",
