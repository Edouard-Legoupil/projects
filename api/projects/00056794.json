The project will build on the strengths gained through the previous experience and efforts in developing DGIs and MDG9 target indicators and institutionalization of the governance assessment processes. The aim of the project is to further build the capacities of the government agencies that are formally assigned as reporting bodies on the MDG9 implementation and civil society in the collection, maintenance and analysis of governance related data and to assist the development of an inclusive and consultative framework for the systematic assessment and monitoring of governance goals and targets expressed in the MDGs-based National Development Strategy and the Government Action Plan for 2008-2012. In order to increase national ownership, the scope of the governance assessments will be expanded into sectoral and local levels. As such, sector-specific and decentralised governance assessment tools will be developed and piloted in a selected sector and local governments for further replication in other sectors and areas. The project will attempt to maximize the synergies among the ongoing initiatives taken by UNDP and other donors in the area of democratic governance assessment.",
