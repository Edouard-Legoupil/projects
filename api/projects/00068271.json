The objective of this project is to increase youth political participation and civic engagement in local governance through three strategic phases that will address lack of inclusive youth access to participation using an online portal and game on local governance. Strategic partnerships will be created with government entities, development partners and local NGOs to expand project outreach. UNV will bring to the project a sense of engagement and civic activism among young people. Similarly, UNDP's ongoing partnerships and initiatives on youth skills building, strengthening political participation, youth employment and others will result in a holistic approach towards young people's empowerment as agents of change.","output_id":"00083553","output_title":"Youth Participation in Local G","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00068271","project_title":"Youth Participation in Local Governance in Jordan","region_id":[],"start":"2012-08-01","subnational":[]}
