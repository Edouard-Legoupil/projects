Attention to DRM in Pakistan has traditionally focused upon the management of floods including preparedness, response/recovery and mitigation measures. However, recent disaster events have increased awareness within government, the development community and among the public that Pakistan is a high disaster risk country. The government has taken first steps to institutionalize a Disaster Risk Management system managed by a government organization with a larger emphasis on involving multiple sectors and actors.",
