The country continues to live with an active volcano, as well as impacts of hurricanes over the past 10 yars.  The country therefore has a very high hazard profile and limited human resources.  It is dependent on external assistance, primarly from the Government of the United Kingdom, the European Union and other development partners.  UNDP has supported the country through technical assistance including managing United Naitons Volunteers (UNVs) in the past.  Current focus will be aligned to the country's Comprehensive Disaster Management strategy.  UNDP through this project will assist the Government of Montserrat with:-\r\n\r\nOutput 1:  Capacity development and strengthening  the national Disaster Risk Management mechanism through support to strategies and plans as well as training.",
