            "description": "In order to achieve the project Objective, five inter-related Outcomes need to be secured.  \r\n\r\nOutcome 1 is strengthened coordination mechanisms at the central level for biodiversity conservation. This Outcome is directly related to the CBPF. This Outcome underpins all other work in the project and the work of many partner projects. Outcome 2 focuses on improving the framework, system and capacity for biodiversity planning. However, for biodiversity planning to be more effective, it should be linked to socio-economic and sectoral planning. Hence, Outcome 3 focuses on socio-economic and sectoral planning, and ensuring that this planning plays a positive role in biodiversity conservation. In addition, for more meaningful and effective planning, stronger links with the financial and budgetary processes are necessary, and increased financial resources are also required. Hence, Outcome 4 focuses on raising support for biodiversity in the financial agencies and diversifying funding sources\u2013 including the private sector. Finally, Outcomes 5 addresses the critically strategic issue of adapting biodiversity conservation to climate change.",
