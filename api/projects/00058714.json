The first step of this project is development and adoption of a Sustainable Energy Action Plan for City of Banja Luka as a pilot exercise, which will serve as basis for demonstrating and advocating adoption and implementation of the model in other BiH town and cities. Through SEAP development process local capacities in climate change mitigation will be strengthen. Adoption and implementation of the same  model in other BiH cities / municipalities will contribute to creating a network of communities who will become drivers of the changes and sustainable development  in BiH. The project will further support SEAP implementation through work on drafting new legislation for environmental funds, development and implementation of Energy Management Information System (EMIS) in BiH, development and implementation of energy efficiency advocacy campaign in order to raise awareness of the BiH population on EE  and provide capacity building and technical assistance in order to enable stakeholders in BiH to implement EE and RES related activities.",
