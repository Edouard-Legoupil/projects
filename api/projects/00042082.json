The activities of the SNC formulation project are a continuation and an update of the work undertaken by the Lao PDR in preparing its First National Communication during 1997-2000. In addition, gender concerns and perspectives will be taken into account throughout the project cycle. The project has four main outputs: (a) an inventory of greenhouse gases; (b) programmes containing measures to facilitate adequate adaptation to, and mitigation of, climate change; (c) programmes and plans that are considered relevant for the achievement of the objectives of the UNFCCC and (d) preparation of the SNC of Lao PDR. Besides the preparation of the SNC, the project will further increase the general awareness of climate change issues and build national capacity in the Lao PDR. The project will also facilitate the integration of climate change and gender concerns into the national development policies and plans by strengthening cooperation between all relevant stakeholders.","output_id":"00048165","output_title":"Second National Communication","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"PIMS 2948 CC EA 2 ND NAT COM Climate Change Enabling Activity for the Preparation of the Second National Communication (Sel-assessment exercise)","project_id":"00042082","project_title":"Second National Communication","region_id":[],"start":"2006-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00042082","lat":"18","lon":"105","name":"Lao PDR","precision":"9","type":"PCL"}]}
