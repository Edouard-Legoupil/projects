Its main objective is to contribute to local economic development as an attempt for poverty alleviation and inclusive participation of local communities in their well-being. The project is linked to the UNDP ART GOLD Programme which supports the local actors in sharing comprehensive territorial development strategy in order to decrease the risks of business failures. This approach is based upon the identification of strategic market areas and consequent prioritization at sectoral and territorial level for the optimum utilization of the local resources, business growth, easy access to credit (small and medium loans), capacity development, and territorial marketing strategies. In order to achieve these objectives UNDP AGL is establishing Local Economic Development Agencies (LEDAs) in each area of the Programme, which will provide the necessary and permanent support to the above mentioned development strategy. CDR, through the Economic and Social Fund for Development will be the national implementing agent of this component, particularly for the establishment of the Guarantee Fund at one national bank and further on for the management of the this agreement aiming at enabling the local SMEs and cooperatives to have easy access to credits for their business development.",
