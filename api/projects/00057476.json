Through this transfer of implementation responsibilities, the programme intends to strengthen local human and institutional capacity development. Such a modality enables local partners to increase their competencies in implementing complex development interventions with UNDP providing mentoring and coaching services. This modality also leads to increased local ownership over the programme\u2019s implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expected results of the four activities are:\r\n- Increased local capabilities in participatory planning and implementation of development projects;\r\n- Increased effectiveness in the delivery of public services;\r\n- More than 6,000 people will benefit from improved living conditions; and\r\n- 500 families have increased revenues.",
