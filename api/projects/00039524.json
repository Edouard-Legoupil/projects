In addition, this project will help strengthen Jordan\u2019s capacity to fulfill its commitments to the UNFCCC on a continuing basis. The structure of this project is based on the country\u2019s previous experience and studies already identified under a stocktaking exercise. The main components of the project are: (a) an inventory of greenhouse gases for the year 2000 and time series 1994-2000; (b) an analysis of potential measures to mitigate the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Jordan; (c) an assessment of potential impacts of climate change in Jordan and adaptation measures; (d) preparation of the Second National Communication of Jordan and submission to the COP. In addition, public awareness activities and stakeholder consultations will be cross-cutting along the overall course of this project. Therefore, the preparation of the Second National Communication is expected to enhance general awareness and knowledge on climate change-related issues in Jordan, and to help into highly taking them into account in the process of national planning and policy.",
