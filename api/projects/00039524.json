            "description": "This project aims at assisting Jordan with the enabling activities necessary to undertake the Second National Greenhouse Gas Inventory and to prepare and report the Second National Communication to the Conference of Parties in accordance with guidance of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In addition, this project will help strengthen Jordan\u2019s capacity to fulfill its commitments to the UNFCCC on a continuing basis. The structure of this project is based on the country\u2019s previous experience and studies already identified under a stocktaking exercise. The main components of the project are: (a) an inventory of greenhouse gases for the year 2000 and time series 1994-2000; (b) an analysis of potential measures to mitigate the increase in greenhouse gas emissions in Jordan; (c) an assessment of potential impacts of climate change in Jordan and adaptation measures; (d) preparation of the Second National Communication of Jordan and submission to the COP. In addition, public awareness activities and stakeholder consultations will be cross-cutting along the overall course of this project. Therefore, the preparation of the Second National Communication is expected to enhance general awareness and knowledge on climate change-related issues in Jordan, and to help into highly taking them into account in the process of national planning and policy.",
