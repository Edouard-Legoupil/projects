            "description": "Participation is crucial for human development as it enlarges people\u2019s capacities and choices. One of the main conditions for human centred development is effective participation which is facilitated through civil society organizations.  The reality of civil society in Kosovo is one of dispersed knowledge and weak capacities for lobbying and advocacy to government for policy dialogue. Civil society is viewed as an entity for small service delivery, and not as a tool for democratization and the accountability of government. Technical capacities for project development and management exist and are a sound base which needs to be built upon to ensure that civil society can transform from post-conflict operations to respond to the new governance challenges of European integration. Kosovo Human Development Report (KHDR) 2008 will analyse the role of the civil society in Kosovo in terms of both facilitation of the development processes and its contribution to human development as well as its role in deepening democracy in Kosovo society and institutions.",
