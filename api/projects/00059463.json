            "description": "With the highest poverty rate in Lebanon, Akkar remains the most deprived region in Lebanon when looking at various socio-economic and development indicators. In partnership with the Council of Development and Reconstruction (CDR), UNDP implemented the first phase of the Regional Development Programme in Akkar (2003-2009) covering the majority of Akkar villages where municipalities are operational. The Programme focused on empowering the existing 95 municipalities in Akkar and developing their capacities for better service delivery at the local level. Notwithstanding, the programme was not able to target many villages due to the absence of local authority representation or local institutions (municipalities, cooperatives, local associations) mainly in Wadi Khaled, the most prominent poverty pocket in Lebanon. Thus, the expansion of the programme to Wadi Khaled to assess and address the needs in the absence of local authorities and foreseen plans to establish five new municipalities following the Municipal 2010 Elections. The programme will implement the prioritized needs in the previously targeted region based on the local development plans formulated during the phase I of the programme. Municipalities, youth groups, cooperatives and local associations (with special focus on the women associations) will remain the main partners benefiting from the programme activities.",
