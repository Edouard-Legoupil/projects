This project will allow (a) first to lift the identified barriers that prevent an efficient management of the country\u2019s Protected Areas (PA), including the enhancement of the legal security of all PAs; (b) then to create synergies among various sectors around protection of nature and the environment in order to ensure a stable resources base to support the economy and sustain prosperity of the country along its people; (c) to use two protected areas sites (Kibira and Ruvubu); (d) to design, test and validate models of participatory management of PAs, that will be focused on partnerships (public & private sectors, local communities and donors); and (e) finally to promote regional integration through cross border conservation of biodiversity programmes between the neighboring countries (Rwanda, Tanzania) with Burundi.",
