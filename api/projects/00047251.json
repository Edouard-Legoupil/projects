To achieve this, the project will install energy efficiency and renewable energy equipment in selected public buildings and facilities (schools, hospitals, municipal street lighting, etc.) in three target areas (South, Bekaa and Akkar) highly affected by the July 2006 conflict. Furthermore, the project will monitor the direct impacts of the installed equipment on the beneficiaries' energy bills to set the basis for future national sustainable energy strategies.  The project is line with ongoing national efforts to improve patterns of energy consumptions and costs.",
