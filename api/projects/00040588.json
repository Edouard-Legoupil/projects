Over a period of five years, the project will improve the current development framework of the Ecoregion by strengthening national capacity to prepare and implement a set of integrated actions that collectively will avoid the default scenario and secure global biodiversity benefits. To this end, project outputs will include: strengthening and expansion of the existing protected area system, including the designation of transboundary PAs and the creation of an integrated network of PAs (Econet); increased levels of biodiversity awareness and advocacy among all stakeholders; the conservation of selected rare and endangered species in the ASE; improvement of information on the region\u2019s biodiversity, including traditional environmental knowledge, and the integration of that information into decision-making; strengthening of legislation, compliance mechanisms and institutional capacity in planning and management of land and resource uses through the incorporation of biodiversity conservation values; the development of sustainable and biodiversity friendly alternative livelihoods for local populations; the direct involvement of local populations in the conservation of biodiversity; and strengthening of transboundary cooperation in biodiversity conservation initiatives among states, as well as regional governments and administrations in the region.",
