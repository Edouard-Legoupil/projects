Significant Climate Change benefits will be incurred through carbon emission avoidance and increased carbon capture - the former through reduction of deforestation rates and increased efficiency of transformation and final end-use of Caatinga biomass, and the latter through reforestation of degraded lands. Biodiversity benefits will be achieved through supporting actions to enhance ecosystem integrity and conservation at the landscape level establishing ecological corridors between key existing protected areas using different management tools. Project actions will also produce critical watershed conservation in a drought prone area, halting land degradation and the advance of desertification.",
