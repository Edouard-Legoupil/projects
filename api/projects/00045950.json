Designed to reduce armed violence in Kosovo within the overarching framework of democratic governance, KOSSAC Phase 3 will further support the work of the Kosovo SALW Control Commission, the Ministry of Internal Affairs and implementation of the Kosovo SALW Control Action Plan including a voluntary surrender initiative.. Implementation of the Action Plan will result in increased public confidence in the security providers , and reduced public demand for small arms as means of protection.
