The project will achieve this by integrating land-use and transport planning to promote the use of bicycles and public transport modes, while rationalising parking tariffs and initiating social networking programmes to promote shared taxi and car use. Together, these activities are expected to reduce the growth of personal vehicle use and improve the transport management infrastructure to support the environmentally friendly development of Belgrade. They will result in direct energy savings of 285 kton CO2/year; and, indirect savings from the increased share of energy efficient transport modes of 71 kton CO2/year.",
