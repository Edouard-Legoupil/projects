Seven faculties of Cairo University will be involved in this double pronged project -made up of an awareness raising component and a research component - through the diverse awareness raising initiatives and events and the allocation of five research grants for applied studies on MDGs.  Dealing with University Students and Academia will ensure the establishment of a sustainable virtuous circle between knowledge creation and knowledge dissemination, thus engaging the students with different targeted strategies. The principal envisaged activities are events (such as job fairs), competitions, lectures, seminars and the offer of prizes such as grants and others. The expected outputs of the project are the development and implementation of a MDGs research platform and the increase of MDGs awareness rates",
