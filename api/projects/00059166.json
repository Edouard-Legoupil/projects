In addition, the programme will lead to the development of pilot mini-Water and Sanitation master plans in Wassit (Kut city), and Salah al-Din (Tikrit and/or Samarra) cities, and well as Pilot mini-Sanitation Master Plan in the city of Erbil.\r\nIn addition, to the physical interventions limited to these three governorates, capacity building will be provided both to the three governorates and three adjacent selected ones; thus, the adjacent ones will also be able to formulate their own master plans and replicate the physical interventions undertaken in Anbar, Sulaymaniyah and Thi-Qar. Moreover, specialized equipment and machinery shall be procured for the usage of the governorates of Anbar, Sulaymaniyah and Thi-Qar, including water tankers, sewage tankers, jetting vehicles, garbage compactors and garbage collection containers.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the programme will, in all of the six governorates be accompanied by: Sanitary inspections on main water resources, Strengthened capacity building of government staffs in sanitary inspections and water quality monitoring through on-the-job training and specialized training programmes and awareness campaigns on sanitation and hygiene issues to safeguard public health in the peripheral/ high risk areas in the selected governorates.",
