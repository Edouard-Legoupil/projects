The information gathered by peer educators will be discussed at the training sessions which are planned to take at sub-regional levels, and the final results of the needs and issues identified would be presented at the regional-level Youth Forums.  Special attention will be paid to the inclusion of disadvantaged youth, so that their needs are also reflected in the assessment, and they are also given opportunity to participate in discussions and training sessions.",
