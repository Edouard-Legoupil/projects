This capacity includes enhancing coordination and effective response mechanism to the pandemic through community voluntary action based on the fact that most of the activities being undertaken at the community level, such as community-based care and support services, are done on a voluntary basis. To this effect, the designed and formulated project will enhance the efforts for volunteer activities in the fight against HIV and AIDS in the country given the fact that Swaziland has the world\u2019s highest infection rate and relies on volunteer activities for care and support for those affected and infected by HIV.\r\n\r\nPromotion and harnessing of volunteerism for effective development through improving coordination of those volunteer organizations and agencies that provide essential services in the national campaign against the spread of HIV and AIDS in the country. The project will strengthen the capacities of civil society actors (particularly in the areas of organizational development, financial management systems and monitoring and evaluation mechanisms) so that these actors become a more active and strategic partners to the government in delivering key services to those infected and affected by HIV.  In addition, implementing agencies at national, regional and chiefdom (community) levels will be assisted to improve service delivery through increased transparency, probity and accountability.",
