            "description": "This project, jointly carried out by UNDP Mauritius and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), funded by UNDP\u2019s Democratic Governance Thematic Trust Fund (DGTTF), aims to support the transformation of the Mauritius Police Force into a Police Service through (1) the development of a medium to long-term National Policing Strategic Planning Framework (NPSF), and (2) catalytic assistance in the operationalization of key components of the NPSF, notably through the building of a permanent Strategic Planning Capability at Headquarters and Divisional levels.\r\n\r\nThe NPSF was officially launched in February 2010 after a year of development led by a Core Team of Police Officers put in place by the Commissioner of Police, under the mentorship and technical guidance of two \u201cPolice and Strategic Planning\u201d experts placed at their disposal by UNDP and UNODC. It is comprised of six stand-alone, interrelated \u201cBlue Prints\u201d aiming for the following objectives: \r\n\r\n(1) Setting up of a permanent Strategic Planning capability;\r\n\r\n(2) Enhancement of the Mauritius Police reactive capability;\r\n\r\n(3) Intelligence-Led Policing / Development of pro-active responses;\r\n\r\n(4) Community Policing / Increased accountability to the public;\r\n\r\n(5) Establishment of a Human Resource Management system;\r\n\r\n(6) Achieving a Human Rights-compliant organization / Commitment to professional standards. \r\n\r\nThe 2010 phase of this project will focus on strengthening the Strategic Planning structures and competences of the Mauritius Police and guiding the roll-out of certain Blue Prints (starting with the \u201cCommunity Policing\u201d and \u201cIntelligence-Led Policing\u201d ones, regarded as catalytic for the successful operationalization of other Blue Prints).",
