Its overall aim is to provide Arab stakeholders with the requisite tools to work on reducing corruption risks and adopt better standards and practices in this field. The UNDP Regional Bureau for Arab States will implement this four-year project (2011-2014) with the support of strategic partnerships at the national, regional and international levels. ACIAC comprises four main components that are designed to jointly contribute to the empowerment of beneficiaries in terms of developing, implementing and monitoring anti-corruption policies and programmes in a more effective and inclusive manner. These components are: Anti-corruption and integrity assessments; Implementation of the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC); Integrity in sectors that deliver basic services; Anti-corruption in crisis-affected countries.",
