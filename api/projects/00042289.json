            "description": "The overall purpose of the project is to contribute to a better understanding of the Lake Balaton ecological and socio-economic system\u2019s vulnerability and resilience arising from multiple forces of global and local change, including land use, demographic, economic and climate change and build capacity for more effective policy-making and adaptation measures in response. The project is complementing ongoing policy initiatives and scientific research, and has a clear niche by focusing on better understanding the vulnerability of the Lake and its watershed from an integrated perspective. Due to Lake Balaton\u2019s high profile and a focused engagement and influencing strategy, the project will significantly increase awareness of climate change impact, vulnerability and adaptation issues locally, nationally and internationally.",
