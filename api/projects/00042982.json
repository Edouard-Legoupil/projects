Without its implementation the barriers to the mainstreaming of sustainable land management would persist and not provide an enabling environment for the effective implementation of the NAP, and the process of land degradation would continue to be a major threat to the sustainable development of Trinidad and Tobago. The outputs of this project would:\r\n\uf0a7\tstimulate activity for the integration of sustainable land management into the development planning framework; \r\n\uf0a7\tallow for the enhancement of technical skills within relevant government agencies and resource users; and\r\n\uf0a7\t enable the development of public education initiatives that would raise public awareness and sensitivity, and which could lead to the behavioural change  proposed in the NAP;\r\n\uf0a7\tStrengthen the capacity of civil society organizations to allow for their interactive involvement in the implementation of the NAP in the spirit of the bottom up participatory approach of the UNCCD;\r\n\uf0a7\tmobilize adequate financial resources for the successful implementation of the programmes and projects articulated in the NAP.",
