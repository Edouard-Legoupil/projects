It will also contribute to the development of key capacities required for the management of pre-accession funds and for proactive engagement in partnerships with local CSOs and businesses. The project aim will be achieved through the implementation of the following objectives: (1) Participatory development of entity training strategies; (2) Establishment of an effective training system based on entity training strategies; (3) Support to training facilities in delivering a first cycle of priority training programmes; (4) Strengthening of human resource management and development functions in BiH municipalities; and (5) Strengthening local training providers via established training support facilities.",
