Moreover, the training system will ensure that know-how created through different projects remains in the country and contributes to further development of the overall system of local governance. It will also contribute to the development of key capacities required for the management of pre-accession funds and for proactive engagement in partnerships with local CSOs and businesses. The project aim will be achieved through the implementation of the following objectives: (1) Participatory development of entity training strategies; (2) Establishment of an effective training system based on entity training strategies; (3) Support to training facilities in delivering a first cycle of priority training programmes; (4) Strengthening of human resource management and development functions in BiH municipalities; and (5) Strengthening local training providers via established training support facilities.",
