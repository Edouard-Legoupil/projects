If found feasible, ODS waste from the neighbouri9ng ECOWAS countries will be contemplated as well. The risks and barriers (economic, legal, Basel and Rotterdam conventions stipulates, etc.) for such interventions will be identified and means for mitigation will be formulated.\r\n\u2022\tIt also seeks to develop an efficient and cost effective logistic framework for the transport, storage and shipment of ODS in Ghana.",
