The NEEP involves supporting energy auditing in the industrial and commercial sectors, utility load management, setting policies and regulations for residential buildings and energy-consuming appliances efficiency, improving energy efficiency information exchange, promoting energy services and private sector investments and utilization of efficient technologies. It will enhance and encourage outreach and awareness building initiatives on energy efficiency through campaigns, workshops and capacity building.",
