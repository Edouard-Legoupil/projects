Brazil, as signatory to the Stockholm Convention, is committed to the complete phase-out and destruction of PCBs by 2025 or earlier.  The main objective of this 5 year project would be to fully develop Brazil\u2019s capability to manage and dispose of PCB oils, PCB containing equipment and other PCB waste in a sustainable manner in order to achieve timely compliance with the Stockholm Convention requirements for PCB management, and to minimize risk of PCB exposure to the population and the environment. As outlined in the Stockholm Convention, priority will be given to higher concentration PCB materials and sensitive sites.  The project aligns with the strategic priorities for the GEF-4 POPS focal area and comprises the following components: \n\u2022\tOutcome 1 - Strengthening of the legal, administrative and standardized procedures framework for PCB management and disposal, \n\u2022\tOutcome 2 - Management of identified PCB oils and PCB contaminated waste in a manner that that minimizes human and environmental exposure to PCB\nOutcome 3 - Environmentally sound disposal of identified PCB by means of demonstration projects.",
