            "description": "The objective of the project is to facilitate a comprehensive market transformation of the Egyptian market towards the use of more energy efficient electrical appliances at a level where cost-efficiency is proven. This is envisaged to be achieved through the combination of regulatory tools such as minimum energy performance standards (MEPS) and information labels, enhanced public awareness, capacity building and attractive financing mechanisms. The project will strengthen the regulatory and institutional framework, develop monitoring and enforcement mechanisms, and provide training to public authorities and other relevant stakeholders. It will explore and test different financial incentives complemented by extensive public outreach campaigns.",
