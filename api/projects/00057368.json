            "description": "The globally significant biodiversity of Montenegro is partially protected through a system of protected areas covering some 7.88% of the territory. Under current conditions, the Protected Area System (PAS) of Montenegro is however not effectively safeguarding the country\u2019s unique biodiversity as: (i) a number of natural ecosystem processes, habitats and species (notably in the marine environment) are not adequately represented in the existing PAS; (ii) the capacity of the institutions responsible for the planning management of the protected areas is generally weak; and (iii) the value of the PAS to the socio-economic well being of society is poorly understood and demonstrated.\r\nThe proposed long-term solution for biodiversity conservation in Montenegro\u2019s terrestrial and marine areas is a reconfigured system of protected areas that is designed to protect biodiversity while optimizing its ecological service functions \u2013 under an effective and adaptive management regime. This solution is seen to rest on two main pillars. First, the long-term solution depends on adequate capacities of PA agencies to identify, resource and focus suitable management efforts on highly sensitive and/or biologically significant areas within the existing network of protected areas, while also being able to identify, prioritise and target gaps in representation that can be filled through PA expansion efforts. Second, the solution requires better alignment of protected areas with the regional socio-economic development priorities, and improved responsiveness of PA management to the needs of local communities. Effective mechanisms for inter-sectoral co-operation that bring to bear the relevant strengths of various management agencies and branches of Government and civil society will then be required to solve the increasingly complex conservation challenges facing protected areas\r\nThe normative solution that the project seeks to engineer is characterized by: (i) the design and development of a scientifically-based ecological network and protected area system that would adequately conserve and protect a representative sample of the country\u2019s marine, freshwater and terrestrial biodiversity; (ii) the identification and design of a new marine PA for Montenegro; (iii) the establishment of the first Regional Park category of protected area for Montenegro as a first step toward the future establishment of a network of regional parks; (iv) the restructuring and strengthening of protected area institutions; (v) the development of protected area management skills within these protected area institutions; and (v) the piloting of the mainstreaming of protected areas into the local regional socio-economic development priorities - in particular the development of the nature-based tourism industry. \r\nThis project will contribute to achieving global environmental benefits by mitigating the threats to the biodiversity contained in at least 108,866 ha of protected areas of Montenegro. This will be achieved by overcoming the barriers that prevent the effective management of the terrestrial protected area system, by extending and enhancing the protection status to at least 21,000 ha, and by creating the enabling conditions for the establishment of a new Marine Protected Area in Montenegro\r\nOutput 1.1 Protected area gap assessment completed resulting in a comprehensive plan for a representative PAS\r\nOutput 1.2 Ecological values and management arrangements of existing protected areas revalidated\r\nOutput 1.3 Regional Park Komovi (21,000 ha) established\r\nOutput 1.4 Feasibility assessment  and agreed designation plan for establishment of Marine Protected Area in Platamuni \r\nOutput 2.1 Geospatial database and decision-support system for the protected area system established and functional\r\nOutput 2.2 Management and governance options for protected areas reviewed\r\nOutput 2.3 Skills of PA staff developed\r\nOutput 2.4 Involvement and beneficiation of local communities ensured in Komovi Regional Park",
