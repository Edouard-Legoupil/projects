Industries and Governments in developing countries will also benefit from a better understanding of the potential implications of the global HCFC demand and supply scenario. Inter-linkages with other conventions will also be looked particularly in relation to HCFC\u2019s having a comparatively high global warming potential. The project will also assess the potential for synergies in the management of HCFC phase out and the management of other chemicals (i.e. related to other ozone depleting substances, HFCs, POPs etc).",
