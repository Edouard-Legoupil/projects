            "description": "Viet Nam is currently aiming at becoming a modern and industrialized country by 2020, and is expected to access middle-income country status circa 2010. Accession to middle income country (MIC) status will have deep implications in terms of the development issues that the Government will have to address and the necessary policies that will need to be formulated and implemented to effectively address those issues. Accession to MIC status will also have significant implications with respect to official development assistance and the role of donors. It is expected that as a MIC Viet Nam will no longer be eligible for funding windows that it has been accessing thus far and that the overall amount of ODA made available to the country will be drastically reduced. It is also widely expected that a number of donors will reduce their involvement in Viet Nam and that some might not even maintain a permanent presence in the country.\r\n\r\nThis project seeks to contribute to the delivery of development results identified in the One Plan under the One UN/Delivering as One Initiative.  It also aims at contributing to the fulfillment of commitments of the United Nations in Viet Nam, including UNDP to increase its role in the provision of policy research and policy advice to respond to the needs and requests of national partners.\r\n\r\nThe project has the following objectives: \r\n1. Contributing to UN reform \u201cDelivering as One\u201d, and in particular the One UN initiative in Viet Nam, which placed heightened expectations on the UN to take a prominent role in relation to policy advice and research.\r\n2. Contributing to the new corporate emphasis within UNDP and a number of UN agencies globally on moving upstream to focus on policy advice and policy research.\r\n3. Responding to the changing needs of Government, and roles of donors and the UN, as Viet Nam enters middle-income status, with a transition away from basic infrastructure development, direct service delivery and capacity-building towards supporting key policy choices.\r\n4. Contributing to policy research rooted in a rich and nuanced understanding of the national context and to the formulation of effective policies addressing economic, climate change and governance issues such as corruption, public administration reform and rule of law/judicial reform, in line with the One Plan.\r\n5. Enriching the quality of policy advice provided by UNDP to the Government of Viet Nam and to enhance the impact of the UN/UNDP\u2019s interventions related to economic issues, governance and climate change in Viet Nam.  \r\nIn addition to policy contributions to the existing project portfolio, focus will therefore be placed on:\r\n- Conducting policy research on key challenges facing the country\u2019s economy (paying special attention to developing the capacity of national research institutions to take innovative approaches to emerging priorities) and then disseminating these through policy papers and policy dialogues to policymakers, donors and the media.",
