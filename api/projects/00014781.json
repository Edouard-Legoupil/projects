These teams have been surveying and taking records for the planning of stockpile destruction, which is due to start in 2009. Furthermore Mine Action has been doing landmine impact surveys and mine risk education classes in the Bay and Bakool regions. During 2008, UNDP Mine Action worked with a director in the TFG Ministry of Interior on developing national demining capacity. \r\n\r\nAll these operations are currently underway although support from international experts has been limited because of insecurity. A plan to support south-central Somalia from Puntland and Mandera in Kenya or PL is being developed as a way to ensure the various components can continue to be implemented. Advocacy and victim support are not being undertaken within south-central Somalia currently, as victim support is more the responsibility of the ICRC and WHO, and advocacy against anti-personnel mines is ongoing in collaboration with Geneva Call and the International Campaign to Ban Landmines (ICBL).  Following an external assessment of the mine action operations, agreement was reached whereby UNMAS will assume operations in South Central, while UNDP assumes will to strengthen responsibility for maintaining ongoing capacity building mine action programmes in PL and SL with the aim of nationalizing mine action activities. This is part of a strategic decision by UN as UNMAS is the special mission for Mine Action.",
