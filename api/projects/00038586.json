            "description": "The How-to Guide to MDG-based NDS, with supporting training modules, will provide practical and operational guidance on advocacy and awareness, data and policy analysis, strategic planning processes, localization and implementation, monitoring and evaluation.  The manual will consist of sections focused on practical operations and pragmatic approaches to the range of skills and expertise necessary for the achievement of the MDGs.  The How-to Guide would summarize the best of hands-on experience in dealing with these issues, while also providing a consistent UNDP perspective on pro-poor strategies and policy approaches, its overall objective being to strengthen country ownership and national leadership of development and poverty reduction.\r\nThe \"How-toGuide\" will function as the in-country transmission mechanism for UNDPs broader strategic support to the MDGs.  Once the \"How-to Guide\" and training modules have been developed, they will be tested and applied through trainings at the country level, involving Regional Centers and UNCTs.  On-going UNCT follow-up support-either virtually through the MDG-Net, BDP, the UNDG MDG Policy Network, or integrated support missions will be provided as appropriate.",
