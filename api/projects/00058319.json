Cape Verde\u2019s biodiversity is globally significant. However,it is threatened by a variety of anthropogenic pressures. In coastal and marine ecosystems, localised pollution driven by rapid tourism and real estate developments, exacerbated by unsustainable fishing, lead to a continuous loss of coastal habitat. In terrestrial ecosystems, overgrazing and land degradation aggravated by invasive plant species, are pervasive threats to ecological equilibrium. Ultimately, climate change looms in the horizon as another consequential threat for Cape Verdean ecosystems. The management of Protected Areas is a vital instrument: (1) to safeguard Cape Verde\u2019s unique biodiversity; and (2) to engage communities surrounding PAs in a sustainable use of natural resources supported by environmental conservation.",
