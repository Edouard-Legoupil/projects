This project is a technical cooperation project between the Islamic Republic of Iran Customs Administration (IRICA), UNCTAD and UNDP. Through this project, UNCTAD will provide appropriate technical services and other resources for the implementation of e-customs solutions through the latest state of art management information system ASYCUDAWORLD. With such a tool, IRICA will establish a transparent clearance processing mechanism with a Document Tracking Utility available for all agents and will expand its Direct Trader Input (DTI) through the internet. The ASYCUDAWORLD system is based on a state of the art IT technology (web-based, Java, XML\u2026) that can be used as the core element of the implementation of e-government and e-business in the country. The duration of the project will be at least 24 months and will be implemented in two phases: Phase I \u2013 prototyping and piloting of the system in Customs Headquarters and at a designated pilot site, and Phase II \u2013 rollout of the system to all Customs offices and fiscal points. A major component of the project will be the transfer of technology that UNCTAD will undertake, through technical and functional training with a view to ensure IRICA the ownership of the system and to create self sufficiency and independence from external technical assistance in the future",
