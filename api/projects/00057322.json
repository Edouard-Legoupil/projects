The focus is on promoting peace at the local level, improving household/community livelihood, contributing to local economic recovery, enhancing social cohesion and strengthening institutional capacities of GoN and non-governmental organizations to plan, coordinate, and deliver livelihood initiatives. Because of the negative impacts of disasters and conflicts in Nepal, this project pursues its goal through a disaster risk and conflict prevention lens, whereby conflict and hazard mapping are at the core of the livelihood assessments, strategy development, and implementation processes.\r\n\r\nThe project will target mainly women, youth, conflict-affected, poor, and other socially excluded and disadvantaged communities and households.  It will strongly complement other GoN and UNDP projects on micro-enterprise development, rural energy services, disaster risk management, and local governance, and will in fact build partnerships with these projects for effective implementation.",
