            "description": "In 2010, a Millenium Development Goals Parliamentary Group (MDGPG) has been established in the Parliament of Georgia under the chairmanship of the Vice-Speaker. This group of 8 MPs brought together the majority party and the opposition with the aim to facilitate the process of working towards attainment of MDGs. Recognizing the gaps in its own capacities, the MDGPG has approached UN Resident Coordinator (UNRC) with the request of provision of long term continuous support to the Group.\r\n\r\nUNDP, UNICEF, UNFPA and UNRC Office have agreed to join financial and human resources to provide much needed analytical support and facilitation to MDGPG. Namely, the primary purpose of this consultancy is the provision of analytical and technical support to effective functioning and outreach of the MDGPG as well as  the collection of data and information on the progress of attaining the Millenium Development Goals in Georgia",
