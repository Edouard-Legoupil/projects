In responding to the challenges of climate change, the country of Belize has committed itself to defining its institutional and legal landscape for climate change adaptation and mitigation, focusing on the roles of various actors, existing institutional capacities and governance issues relating to institutions. The proposed initiative aims to increase Belize's ability to respond to the threats of climate change as a means of ensuring its goal for sustainable economic and human development.
