In addition, this project will help strengthen KSA\u2019s capacity to fulfill its commitments to the UNFCCC on a continuing basis. The structure of this project is based on the country\u2019s previous experience and studies already identified under a stocktaking exercise. The main components of the project are: (a) an inventory of greenhouse gases for the year 2000 and time series 1990-2000; (b) an assessment of steps taken by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to address mitigation (c) an assessment of potential impacts of climate change in KSA and adaptation measures; (d) preparation of the Second National Communication of KSA and submission to the COP.
