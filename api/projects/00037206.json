To achieve this target, a series of investment, non-investment, technical assistance, and capacity building activities will have to be carried out. The National CFC Phase-out Plan will enable the Brazilian Government to phase-out CFC consumption by 01 January 2010. \n\nConsidering this multi-faceted approach it is crucial that flexibility is given to the Brazilian Government to be able to adapt or modify its strategies during implementation of this plan as needs arise. Due to the complex and dynamic nature of SMEs, some proposed strategies or approaches to deal with the CFC phase-out in this sector should be able to evolve over time. This is to ensure that the agreed phase-out target will be met.\n\nThe Brazilian Government and the Executive Committee agreed on US$26.7 million as the total funding from the Multilateral Fund for the total elimination of all Annex A Group 1 substances (CFCs) in all sectors using these substances. The agreed level of funding will be paid out in installments as specified in the Agreement attached. Being a performance based Agreement; future payments will be conditioned to meeting the targets and conditions specified in the Agreement.\n\nWith 3,475 ODP tons of CFCs to be phased out from ongoing projects that have already been approved and funded by the MLF, this proposed funding request will phase out an additional 5,801 ODP tons of Annex A CFCs for a total phase-out of 9,276 ODP tons. Therefore, the overall cost-effectiveness of this National CFC Phase-out Plan is 4.6 US$/Kg ODP.\n\nIMPACT OF THE PROJECT ON THE COUNTRY\u2019S MONTREAL PROTOCOL OBLIGATIONS\nThe approval of this project will result in the elimination of CFCs consumption in Brazil and will allow the country to meet its Montreal Protocol obligations.",
