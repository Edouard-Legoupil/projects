            "description": "This initiation plan seeks to finalize the design of a joint program (with UN Women), aimed at providing capacity building support to the newly established office of the Commissioner for Protection of Equality (CPE) and start up pilot activities related to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) in cases of discrimination. The CPE has been established in May 2009 as a national human rights institution (NHRI) in Serbia, and as the equality body according to the directives of the EU. However, a year after its nomination, EC reports show that the CPE faces challenges in terms of capacity building, which require structured support. In order to assist the design of the joint program, activities will focus on the adaptation and roll-out of an open source ADR Database within the office of the CPE and related capacity building and advocacy activities, in order to gather inputs on the state of affairs within this area of combating discrimination and generate initial capacity for future interventions. An analysis of the existent paths toward justice in Serbia, in the area of antidiscrimination will also be conducted, generating inputs on the manner in which Serbian citizens can obtain legal satisfaction in cases of discrimination (ADR, courts, special procedure before the CPE). The inputs gathered will help design the joint program intervention.",
