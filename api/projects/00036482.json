The Regional Centres will provide UNDP country offices in the Asia and the Pacific with easy access to high quality knowledge and programme services based on global applied research and UNDP lessons learnt; build partnerships and promote regional capacity building initiatives, which allow UNDP, governments and other development partners to identify, create and share knowledge relevant to solving urgent development challenges; and support programme implementation. The Regional Programme will provide new core funding for the posts of the two Regional Managers. The funding for the support units shall be provided through pooling of resources originally allocated to the ongoing regional projects from support and administrative purposes. The programme will also be the unified facility to channel funding of start-up costs for the three facilities  pooled from different sources including a part from the central and XB sources.","output_id":"00039689","output_title":"RAS RCSP-APRC","zero_years":[]},{"award_id":"00036482","budget":[441669.0,1122006.0,677222.0],"crs":"99810","crs_descr":"Sectors Not Specified","donor_budget":[],"donor_country":["MULTI-LATERAL AGENCY","MULTI-LATERAL AGENCY","New Zealand","Australia"],"donor_country_id":["MULTI_AGY","MULTI_AGY","NZL","AUS"],"donor_expend":[413285.0,1085651.0,511270.0],"donor_id":["00012","00023","10279","11234"],"donor_name":["Voluntary Contributions","UN CENTRE FOR HUMAN SETTLEMENTS","NEW ZEALAND AGY FOR INT'L DEVE","Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID)"],"donor_short":["UNDP","UNCHS","NZAID","AusAID"],"donor_type_id":["MULTI_AGY","MULTI_AGY","NON_PROG CTY","NON_PROG CTY"],"expenditure":[413285.0,1085651.0,511270.0],"fiscal_year":["2013","2012","2011"],"focus_area":"-","focus_area_descr":"-","gender_descr":"Gender Equality","gender_id":"1","output_descr":null,"output_id":"00040803","output_title":"RAS RCSP- PSRC","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00036482","project_title":"Regional Centre Support Project","region_id":"RBA","start":"2004-08-26","subnational":[]}
