The Inter Agency Standing Committee (IASC) rolled out the humanitarian cluster system after the July 2010 severe floods to coordinate the humanitarian response.  A revised Flash Appeal (Pakistan Flood Relief & Early Recovery Response Plan) worth US$1.96 billion was launched by the IASC system. The relief response was concluded subsequent to the decision of Government of Pakistan to put an end to the relief activities by the end of January 2011. The UN system and the government agreed to launch Early Recovery Working Group to coordinate early recovery efforts after the end of relief phase. The ERWG was launched under the joint leadership of UNDP and National Disaster Management Authority. ERWG project will facilitate the government and other humanitarian actors in coordination of early recovery activities at all levels. It also aims at building the capacities of working group member organisations to more effectively respond to the early recovery needs of the communities",
