The outputs include a suite of key assessments that provide baselines and identify intervention options concerning institutional, stakeholder, incentives (market/non-market), policy, knowledge management, vulnerability to climate change, and biophysical dimensions at local and (to some limited extent) national levels. The outputs will be used to meet UNDP safeguard processes. The consultations will also be used to identify and negotiate synergies and complementarities across sectors and actors involved in SLM programmes in Tanzania and the Kilimanjaro region",
