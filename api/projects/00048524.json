            "description": "The broad development goal of the project is to influence, transform and develop the market for energy-efficient building operations in Brazil and move towards a less carbon-intensive and more sustainable energy consumption path in the country.\r\nThe project will contribute to improve energy efficiency in the commercial and public buildings sectors by 4.00 million MWh of electricity over 20 years, and directly reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2.01 million ton CO2 equivalent over the same period with estimated post-project and indirect emission reduction of 16.06 tCO2. It will reinforce the local economy by decreasing the dependency of the country on imported fossil fuel and reducing building operation costs for project owners/operators.\r\nThe project promotes cross-convention synergy by reducing GHG and CFC emissions through improving energy efficiency in buildings.",
