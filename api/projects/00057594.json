            "description": "The Civil Society Index (CSI) is an action-research project that aims to assess the state of civil society in countries around the world though a methodology developed and updated by CIVICUS, World Alliance for Citizens Participation.  CSI is a participatory action-research project assessing the state of civil society in countries around the world. The project links this assessment with a reflection and action-planning process by civil society stakeholders, aiming to strengthen civil society in those areas where weaknesses or challenges are detected. By seeking to combine valid assessment, broad-based reflection and joint action, the CSI attempts to make a contribution to the long-going debate on how research can inform policy and practice. The CSI will be implemented for the first time in Albania through a local NGO,  (Institute for Mediation and Democracy) which has been identified by CIVICUS as National Coordinating Organization for this research initiative in Albania.",
