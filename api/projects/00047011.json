Moroccan and Italian NGOs work together on a specific project. Partnership is used as a way to strengthen the capacities of the Moroccan NGOs, by giving assistance on the administration of the projects, exchanging knowledge, integrating Result Based Management (RBM) and Gender mainstreaming in the project and disseminating good practices. Beside that, projects achieve relevant results in poverty reduction and human development.",
