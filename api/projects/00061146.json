Under this output 130 thermal heating systems primarily burning straw will be installed totalling about 35 MWth (average installed capacity of approx. 300 kWth) for the provision of heating for public buildings in rural communities in Moldova. Supporting this, market mechanisms will be used to support the involvement of local fuel suppliers to prepare, store and supply the fuel needed for the installed heating plants. Very focused low-cost actions on policy, regulation, and contracting to support the market environment will make a third, minor output under output 1.",

For each stakeholder type to be reached under output 3, the first step will be the development of training materials, to be placed in the public domain. These materials, to be updated and improved each year, will provide an accessible repository of key information supporting other project components. The stakeholders to be targeted include: municipal management including mayors, civil servants, and teachers; straw-fired boiler operators; fuel suppliers; and school children.",
