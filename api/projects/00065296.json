The Localizing Poverty Reduction Programme is working on the premise that the convergence of government services and poverty alleviation efforts at the local levels shall be ensured. Specifically, the participatory and multi-stakeholder approaches in planning, decision-making, implementation, monitoring and evaluation shall be strengthened and institutionalized.\r\n\r\nAddressing substantially the challenges of poverty such that these would result to changes or improvement in local capacities to satisfy the basic needs of the population requires medium to long term investments and of sustained interventions. Harnessing the direct and continued involvement of the local stakeholders therefore to address long standing issues of poverty require a systematic process of localizing poverty reduction initiatives that would also give way to meaningful convergence of the government, non-government and private sector initiatives. This systematic process of localizing poverty reduction efforts also aims to install processes for adequate, efficient, and prompt delivery of basic services to the poor.","output_id":"00081867","output_title":"Localizing Poverty Reduction"}],"project_descr":" ","project_id":"00065296","project_title":"Localizing Poverty Reduction","region_id":[],"start":"2012-02-01","subnational":[]}
