A Management Information System is in place that enhances transparency and supports personnel processing and strategic planning of human resources in the civil service.\n2. Strategic management of civil service is enhanced (strategic plans developed, Ministerial functional reviews conducted, roles and responsibilities of organisational structures clarified, staffing plans developed, capacity development action plans finalised and\nstrengthened capacity of civil service management issues and roles.\n3. Mechanism in place for the provision, management and monitoring of technical assistance in response to well-identified capacity development needs.\n4. Efficiency and sustainability of capacity development efforts enhanced through targeted training and development of civil servants to increase the core capacities of the government.",
