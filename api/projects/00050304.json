            "description": "The third phase of the Global Programme for Parliamentary Strengthening (GPPS III) has the overall objective of strengthening parliaments\u2019 capacity for deepening democracy and delivering human development. GPPS III builds on two prior phases (GPPS I 1999-2003 and GPPS II 2004-2008) and seeks to accomplish the overall objective by linking national, regional and global approaches, through the following specific objectives:  1) to provide leadership and advocacy in the field of parliamentary development at the global level, 2) to ensure that expertise developed through GPPS III strengthens parliamentary development programming throughout UNDP and the UN system; 3) to support South-South regional cooperation and promote regional knowledge development and exchanges; and 4) to support parliamentary development at the national level in a number of selected countries and to document and share those experiences. \r\nAt the global level, UNDP will continue to play a leadership and advocacy role in the field of parliamentary strengthening through parliamentary assistance programs in more than 65 countries and through its broad network of partnerships with other knowledge and parliamentary strengthening institutions. GPPS will enhance this further via a consensus-building and agenda-setting Parliamentary Development report, continued efforts towards the establishment of benchmarks and standards for democratic parliaments, and through advocacy on the position of minorities and indigenous people in parliament. GPPS III will also contribute to the sharing of Parliamentary development expertise within the UN and with partner organizations in parliamentary development, through the new Parliamentary Knowledge Portal, iKNOWPolitics, and continued staff training and specific knowledge products. At the regional level, GPPS III will focus on the exchange of good practices and knowledge creation and dissemination in the Arab States and West Africa. The activities implemented at the regional level will facilitate the piloting of sensitive issues that cannot easily and immediately be tackled at the national level, such as parliamentary oversight of the security sector and community security issues. At the national level, GPPS III interventions will focus on Algeria, Lebanon, Mauritania and Niger. The national support efforts intend amongst others to reinforce parliament\u2019s engagement in achieving the MDGs, to build budget oversight capacity, to support parliaments\u2019 contribution towards the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption and to reinforce women\u2019s political participation and gender-sensitive policy making.",

In West Africa, the global financial crisis and the threat of a global recession have raised new concerns about the potential impact on African economies and on prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, together with democratic governance challenges.  Across Africa, people demonstrated against desperate social and economic situations and sharp rises in living costs during 2008 (Kenya, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Mauritania). According to the 2009 UN Secretary-General Report on the United Nations Office for West Africa, transnational organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, is increasingly becoming a major source of concern in the sub region. Also, a number of issues continue to pose unacceptable threats to the security of the communities of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries. These include absence of rule of law, social and economic disputes, or human rights abuses. This situation negatively impacts on the structural stability of states, human security and economic and social development.  In order to address these challenges, activities will engage parliamentarians from the West Africa region, with a clear focus on Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau trough a dedicated strategy encompassing a cycle of activities in 2010 and 2011 on the role of parliaments in conflict prevention, recovery, small arms control and community security with the objective of ensuring stronger parliamentary oversight of security sector reform in the region. This cyclic approach, as detailed in this work plan, involves capacity development activities for parliamentarians through the establishment of a regional parliamentary working group, ad-hoc support to emerging needs in order to respond to crisis situation, and knowledge and good practice sharing across the region.",

            "description": "The project \u201cStrengthened Capacities of Parliaments in West Africa with a particular emphasis on conflict prevention and recovery\u201d responds to a clear demand to better address challenges of parliamentary development programming in conflict, post conflict and fragile states. In West Africa, the global financial crisis and the threat of a global recession have raised new concerns about the potential impact on African economies and on prospects for meeting the Millennium Development Goals, together with democratic governance challenges.  Across Africa, people demonstrated against desperate social and economic situations and sharp rises in living costs during 2008 (Kenya, Sierra Leone, Cote d'Ivoire, Senegal, Burkina Faso, Cameroon and Mauritania). According to the 2009 UN Secretary-General Report on the United Nations Office for West Africa, transnational organized crime, particularly drug trafficking, is increasingly becoming a major source of concern in the sub region. Also, a number of issues continue to pose unacceptable threats to the security of the communities of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) countries. These include absence of rule of law, social and economic disputes, or human rights abuses. This situation negatively impacts on the structural stability of states, human security and economic and social development.  In order to address these challenges, activities will engage parliamentarians from the West Africa region, with a clear focus on Sierra Leone, Ivory Coast, Liberia and Guinea-Bissau trough a dedicated strategy encompassing a cycle of activities in 2010 and 2011 on the role of parliaments in conflict prevention, recovery, small arms control and community security with the objective of ensuring stronger parliamentary oversight of security sector reform in the region. This cyclic approach, as detailed in this work plan, involves capacity development activities for parliamentarians through the establishment of a regional parliamentary working group, ad-hoc support to emerging needs in order to respond to crisis situation, and knowledge and good practice sharing across the region.",

Both function as a partnership between organizations working in the same field who have expressed the desire to pool their information and knowledge resources. \r\nThe Parliamentary Development Knowledge Portal will serve as a central repository for information on parliamentary development and a reference point for actors in this field. This reliable centralized source of information on parliamentary development will facilitate more efficient planning, reduce the risk of overlap and duplication and enhance sharing of expertise and lessons learned. The ultimate outcomes of such a knowledge hub will be better use of donor funds, more effective parliamentary development and stronger parliaments.\r\nThe duration of the project is not determined. However, as a starting point GPPS support to the launch and the development of the portal (by financing the Knowledge Manager position) will take place over the course of three years. \r\nFirst discussions on this program component started under GPPS II, during the 2007 and 2008 donor consultations. They noted evaluations of parliamentary strengthening programmes (UNDP, DFID and SIDA) which stressed the need for better coordination among donors and emphasized the importance of sharing information and good practices within the donor and practitioner communities.  UNDP was tasked with developing a proposal for the web hub. The work under GPPS III for the establishment of the Portal will include the identification of lessons learned and experiences from similar multi-organization initiatives for knowledge sharing through a web platform; a strategy for the Portal, a clear management structure and advisory board, a proposal for multiple restrictedaccesses, and a communication campaign/launch plan.
