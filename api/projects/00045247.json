The project will focus on three technical areas including:  Creating understanding current and future climatic vulnerability (in the broadest sense of the term): developing and using information for equitable water allocation in a changing hydrological regime.  Negotiated outcomes to minimize future climatic vulnerability and future climatic risk: Continuing dialogues to sustainable water resources management; and mainstreaming climate change adaptation in the water sector: \nThese three technical outputs will lead to a single measurable outcome: Management and allocation of water in Pangani Basin includes climate change preparation and adaptation and environmental considerations in a sound Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) framework.  \nCo-Finance comes from IUCN\u2019s WANI (Water and Nature Initiative) and the EU and Government.\nThe Project Executing Agency is the Pangani Basin Water Board.
