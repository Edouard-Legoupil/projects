The programme will aim to build a broad consensus among policy makers and society concerning the future direction and goals of the Xiao Kang vision. It will support the definition of suitable Xiao Kang indicators, aligned with MDGs, and the capacity development necessary for improved collection, monitoring, analysis and assessment of data to lead to a clearer understanding of human development issues in China. The programme will promote the use of reliable assessment results as a basis upon which to build, or adjust, policies to meet needs, monitor progress and evaluate performance.
