The latter is currently threatened by the loss of biodiversity-friendly productive systems such as shade coffee which have predominated in this productive landscape for over two centuries. This 7 year project, to be executed by the CIARA Foundation of Venezuela\u2019s Ministry of Popular Economy (MINEP), will address a variety of key barriers impeding the effective mainstreaming of biodiversity into this biodiversity rich productive landscape and arrest current trends affecting the BD value of this landscape mosaic.  The objective of the project is that farmers\u2019 systems remain BD-friendly, as a result of the following outcomes i) increased capacities among producers to apply BD-friendly practices; ii) enabling policy, planning and regulatory frameworks and iii) replication processes from pilot areas. Principal co-financing will be provided through MINEP\u2019s National Coffee Plan",
