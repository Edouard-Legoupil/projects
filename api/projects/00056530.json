The project will improve the coverage of marine and coastal ecosystems by 8.7 million hectares by: a) finalizing the protection of the new 14,000 ha Ingermanland Zapovednik, b) facilitating the expansion or establishment of additional eight MCPA covering 7,680,000 hectares; and c) creating the enabling environment for the protection of an additional 1,006,000 million ha of marine and coastal ecosystems.  The project is also designed to improve management effectiveness of a network of 35 MCPA across Russia covering over 24 million ha.",
