Indonesia is one of the main pilot countries for the initial phase. This will be funded by the government of Norway as part of Northwest International Climate and Forest Initiative which was announced during the UNFCCC conference at Bali in 2007.\r\nThe proposed National Joint Programme (NJP) aims to support The Government of Indonesia (GoI) to timely develop a REDD architecture that will allow a fair, equitable and transparent REDD implementation, and a sustainable contribution of forestry to a reduction of forestry related greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nMulti stakeholder participation in REDD is of critical importance to REDD readiness. Recognizing the importance to do so, the government has been initially working through the IFCA multi stakeholder alliance. IFCA organized and streamlined stakeholders input. Amongst others, this resulted in an initial outline of what was called a REDD supply chain. Furthermore, subject matter related analysis were conducted which fat into a final consolidation report that has formed the foundation for Indonesia\u2019s National REDD Strategy. Recently, the Ministry of Forestry has issued a Ministerial Decrees no. 30/2009 and no. 36/2009, on REDD regulations. The decrees was issued after various in depth multi stakeholder consultations on REDD regulations.\r\nThe multi stakeholder consultations process also includes people and local communities potentially affected by REDD, UNREDD is keenly aware of the concerned raised by local communities and civil society organization (CSOs) of an emerging REDD scheme in Indonesia. On May 2009, an in depth stakeholder consultation with the indigenous people representatives (hereafter referred to as local community representatives) and CSOs was conducted as part of the development of the UNREDD programme. Inputs from consultations had been used to refine the proposal and will guide later implementation.\r\nProvincial and district governments are developing policies and have sound interests in developing REDD as an effort to strengthen forest development in their area. While this initiative needs support, better communication between districts, province and central government is essential to make REDD successful in the longer term. Furthermore, particular attention is required to enhance capacity of local government and society in managing forest in the context of the local development planning, including supporting the establishment and capacity building of forest management units. To support the development o9f the national and international REDD architecture, the programme will also assists local governments with preparing and piloting REDD activities on the ground.
