It focuses on that ultimate result of young people age 15-19 discussing sexual matters and choosing, if they so desire, to adhere to PSI (postponement of sexual intercourse) behavior; and those 15-50 years old already having sex to use a condom in every such sexual occasion,  when having sex with someone other than one\u2019s regular partner. The strategy is based on some understanding of those factors which would hinder these behaviors and those factors which would facilitate them",
