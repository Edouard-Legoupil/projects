The project proposes to achieve this by the production of a National Human Development Report (NHDR) for Jordan each year for three consecutive years, based on the methodology of UNDP\u2019s  global Human Development Reports. In order to produce these reports, the project will conduct research, build an information system for human development indicators, and train local researchers in human development concepts and applications.",
