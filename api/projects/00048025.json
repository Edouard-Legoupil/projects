The proposed programme offers an innovative approach to strengthening the capacities for mainstreaming environment issues into policy planning, resource management and service delivery in BiH, reviving the environment sector which is critically stagnant and threatens to become one of the most serious obstacles on the country\u2019s road to European integration. \r\nThe programme highlights the links between environment and poverty, in a country with a highly inequitable growth pattern, with an approach based on the principles of social inclusion, a cross cutting issue that is a concern of all the UN agencies in the country.
