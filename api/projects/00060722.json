            "description": "The CRMI will continue to support the generation of climate scenarios at scales which are relevant to the Caribbean. In the first phase, CRMI was able to bring together the CCCCC along with INSMET of Cuba and the University of the West Indies. Since then, collaboration, using shared Caribbean expertise is taking place. However, work on climate modelling is long term and, particularly for scales appropriate to SIDS, requires more storage capacity for data than is available to the three institutions at present.  Current work is constrained by storage capacity and this will need to be improved if data relevant to key economic sectors is to be generated. This component will be limited to support to data exchange, improvement of hardware and software at CCCCC and UWI and generating data relevant to key sectors in the economy such as agriculture and tourism",
