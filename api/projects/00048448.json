One of the key elements of the project is the Biodiversity Friendly Fisheries Management Regime (BDFMR) which will be a package of national laws, by-laws and regulations developed and enforced with the objective of stabilizing the endemic fish species in the lake within the framework of a viable, sustainable and enforceable commercial fishery. Stabilization will be achieved through limiting current fishing, controlling the size of introduced species, as well as restocking native species. The project will create the mechanism to ensure that the lessons learned in this project will be captured and replicated initially to other large lakes in Kyrgyzstan with high economic values for fisheries.","output_id":"00058610","output_title":"SAVING ENDEMIC ICHTYOFAUNA","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"Strengthening policy and regulatory framework for mainstreaming biodiversity into fishery sector","project_id":"00048448","project_title":"CONSERVATION OF ISSYK-KUL LAKE ENDEMIC ICHTYOFAUNA","region_id":[],"start":"2008-01-01","subnational":[{"awardID":"00048448","lat":"42.41667","lon":"77.25","name":"Issyk Kul lake","precision":"3","type":"RES"}]}
