This, in turn, is expected to generate global benefits of almost 250,000 tons of CO2 over the same period and almost 113,000 tons CO2/yr thereafter in avoided greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The project will do this by introducing a competitive private power framework to supply the grid with SHP-generated electricity at market-determined prices, assist the Government in closing private sector funded SHP investments. It is envisaged that this project will permit Kyrgyzstan to exploit a substantial portion of the 570-900 MW of its potential SHP capacity.","output_id":"00073756","output_title":"SMALL HYDRO POWER DEVELOPMENT","zero_years":[]}],"project_descr":"Small Hydro Power Development","project_id":"00059088","project_title":"SMALL HYDRO POWER DEVELOPMENT","region_id":[],"start":"2010-01-25","subnational":[]}
