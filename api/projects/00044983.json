Further support and strengthening of the judiciary in a strategic manner is thus needed with a particular focus on the judicial education in Kosovo. Several interventions of the international community aiming at improving the legal education were ad hoc and ultimately unsustainable. Increased support and commitment is needed to ensure the continuous education and knowledge building of practitioners in the justice sector and undertaking of activities which underscore the importance the sector puts on ensuring access to justice for all communities in Kosovo.\nThe UNDP Rule of Law Programme is designed to meet the justice sector\u2019s capacity building needs. In particular, it aims to support the full scope of judicial education in Kosovo by focusing on three key areas: 1) needs assessment of the Law Faculty, 2) capacity of legal professionals and 3) harmonization of legal practices in Kosovo in order to build knowledge and capacity in the judicial sector and ultimately strengthen the protection of human rights and rule of law in Kosovo.",
