It will lead to creating and sustaining a political, legal and social enabling environment able to empower families and communities to abandon FGM/C and other forms of violence against children especially the girl child.  The Joint Programme builds on the major achievements spearheaded by the National Council for Childhood and Motherhood (NCCM) supported by the different UN agencies in Egypt; UNDP, UNFPA, UNICEF and UNIFEM and other bilateral donors which resulted in placing the need to abandon FGM/C and other forms of violence against children as a priority issue on Egypt\u2019s national development agenda.  This joint programme will strengthen, enhance and consolidate the achievements that have taken place. The four pillars of this joint programme are: 1) Institutionalization of the fight of FGM/C, 2) up-scaling, 3) Enhancing partnerships and coordination and 4) Strengthening monitoring and evaluation.\r\nThe outputs of the joint programme are as follows:\r\n1- MOFP has the capacity to mobilize and support line ministries and CPCs to plan and implement strategies against FGM/C. \r\n2- Line ministries have mainstreamed the fight against FGM/C in their programs. \r\n3- Strengthened and expanded operational and regulatory environment to abandon FGM/C at the local level. \r\n4- Effective national and sub-national monitoring and evaluation systems able to measure change. \r\n5- Advocacy and communication strategy strengthened to sustain campaigns denouncing FGM/C.",
