In order to achieve full exercise of Mexican women\u2019s\u2019 civil and political rights, this project critically analyses the implementation of: (i) affirmative temporary measures towards gender mainstreaming within electoral jurisprudence; (ii) strengthening capacities of electoral and political stake-holders; (iii) promote gender sensitive political participation networks within non-governmental and grassroots organizations and academia; (iv) exchange good practices and successful national and regional experiences that will lead to improve research towards the expansion of women\u2019s human rights.  In this line of argument, the project aims to improve and promote gender mainstreaming within electoral institutions at the three levels of government.",
