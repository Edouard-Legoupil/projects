The program foresees the achievement of its objectives through four key intervention methods: a) Prevention: enhanced awareness among women/girls and men/boys on domestic violence and women\u2019s rights in pilot municipalities; b) Protection: increased capacity and financial sustainability of DV protection mechanisms to provide quality services in pilot municipalities; c) Reintegration: enhanced economic independence of (potential) DV survivors and counseling for families and perpetrators; and d) Scaling-up: dissemination, validation and replication of program results & lessons learned through policy dialogue among key stakeholders at different levels.",
