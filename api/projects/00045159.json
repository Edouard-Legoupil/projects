Phase 1 of the program (Years 1-2) will strengthen institutional and technical capacities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Republika Srpska and District Brcko (particularly of key government agencies and NGOs), fostering strategic planning and coordination, improving information management systems, and working towards enabling legislative and policy frameworks.\r\n \r\nPhase 1 will utilize national and international technical assistance to build evidence based programs, training programs, curricula, research, assessments and reviews, peer education tools and programs. Technical Assistance sources will include academic institutions, national and international NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral partners.\r\n\r\nParalleling this process will be the strengthening of capacity at the municipal (local community) level to establish integrated prevention, treatment, care and support in primary health care and other existing health structures.",

Additionally to that key goal, which will ensure that the necessary systems of assistance, awareness raising and education are available to the final beneficiaries throughout BiH, UNDP also takes on its self the responsibility to build capacities of the BiH\u2019s institutions in this sector. With implementation of the GF grant, UNDP and partners will seek to cost-effectively reduce the burden of disease of TB in B&H. This project, based on the WHO-recommended Stop TB Strategy, aims to strengthen all the components of the programmes including the laboratory network, the recording and reporting system, as well as monitoring and evaluation. The proposed strategy is based on a dual approach focused on improving the existing TB programmes performance on one side and to develop a friendly interface for vulnerable groups on the other. The final expected outcome is offering quality TB services to all, facilitating the access to people who most need them. System of Monitoring and Evaluation will be strengthened. The laboratory network will be re-organized and improved according to European standards, keeping bio-safety and quality assurance as a priority.\r\n\r\n Activity 1: To strengthen NTP management including TB medicines management, monitoring and evaluation at all levels\r\n- Number of new smear positive TB notified to the national health authority during a specific period.Baseline  2009- 656\r\n- Number and percentage of new smear-positive TB patients successfully treated (cured plus completed treatment) among the new smear-positive TB patients registered during a specified period.Baseline 2009-498\r\n- Number of TB doctors, nurses, family doctors, sanitary inspectors and NTP managers trained in TB issues Baseline 2009-774\r\n- Number of TB patients supervised by polyvalent patronage nurses (PPN) Baseline 2009-1248 \r\n- Number of people (Roma, IDPs, prisoners, poor and young living in appalling conditions and elderly) screened for TB through clinical questionnaire and  sputum examination.
