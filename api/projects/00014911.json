Such system of monitoring and early warning will produce substantial basis for adoption of responsible policies in maintaining secure environment. The international community would acquire an informed picture of the needs and priorities, and of capacity-building requirements which would be useful in planning practical interventions. Results and lessons learnt will also be communicated to relevant stakeholders in Uzbekistan. Efforts will also be made to ensure the participation of the communities from Uzbekistan in future endeavours in case of their interest.",
