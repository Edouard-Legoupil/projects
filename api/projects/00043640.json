It entails technical assistance to facilitate capacity development within key government agencies. Technical advisors will also engage with CSOs to strengthen their capacities to participate meaningfully in processes for improving local data, and in reviewing and monitoring local government budgets and outputs.\r\nThis project responds to the need for improved coordination and harmonisation between existing donor activities, and for future programme streamlining in the Papua region.  It entails UNDP providing support to strengthen the Regional Planning Agency\u2019s (Bappeda) capacity to map and maintain a database of donor support provided to Papua, and to facilitate routine inter-donor coordination meetings. Through such mechanisms, needs and opportunities for future programmes and activities will be identified, and interventions planned and/or implemented collaboratively.",
