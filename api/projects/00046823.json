Further, the Associations are to be supported in, as follows:  a) coordination and information exchange both among local NGOs and with the respective Government and local authorities and the international community involved in IDP support and b) information dissemination within the IDP community. IDP Associations, though this project support, should primarily focus on prevention of further displacement and crisis, recovery assistance to already existing and potential new IDP caseload, improvement of living conditions of IDPs contributing to durable solutions which are sustainable return and (re)integration.",
