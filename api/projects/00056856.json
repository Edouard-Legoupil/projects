The Aid Information Management System will be linked to national planning and budgeting processes and supported with a three year sustainability package. The proejct will assist FACD to promote the successful operation of the National Action Plan on aid effectiveness. It will finance capacity assessments and capacity development strategies for Ministry of Finance and the National Planning Commission as well as for three line ministries (Ministry of Health, Ministry of Local Development and Ministry of Education). High quality training will be provided for senior and mid-level staff as one component of a broader capacity development strategy. At the systems levels (Aid Management Platform), the policy level (Foreign Aid Policy and National Action Plan), and the capacity level, the project will seek to enhance management for development results - and thus the achievement of national development priorities.",
