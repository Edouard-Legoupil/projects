The impacts of climate change on Cape Verde water resources, particularly on water availability, are predicted to adversely affect human health, agricultural production and food security in both rural and urban areas. Predicted climate change scenarios are likely to constrain long-term development through: (i) increased frequency and severity of drought; (ii) increased rainfall variability, including more frequent events of short and intense rains, causing flash-floods in several catchment areas; and (iii) progressive sea level rise and salt water intrusion in freshwater reservoirs closer to coastal areas. Consequently, a major challenge for Cape Verde is to mainstream climate change adaptation measures into integrated water resource management across different institutional, social and spatial frameworks.",
