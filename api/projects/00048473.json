The Project will undertake high-quality analysis followed by advocacy to contribute to better integration of human development concerns into policies. The Project will also support capacity-building for government officials, CSOs, the media, academia, the private sector and UNDP staff through skills, techniques and tools to analyze issues from a human development perspective, as against a purely technical or sectoral standpoint.",
