The Programme aims to contribute to the government\u2019s efforts in this respect by promoting civil society development and the rule of law through institutional reform, democratic law-making, participation, communications and piloting, with a specific focus on urban-rural balances, gender issues and vulnerable groups. \r\nSpecifically, the programme is to achieve the following outputs:\r\n1. Capacities of the judiciary to deliver fair and transparent justice enhanced, and transparency in decision-making and appointments of judicial personnel, increased.\r\n2. The participatory process for law making is institutionalised, capacities of the legislature for law-making and public engagement enhanced and law harmonization improved. \r\n3. Recognition of the positive role of the civil society is increased; the policy and legal environment of CSOs is improved and perceptions of CSOs enhanced; government capacities to involve CSOs in policy-making and public service delivery  improved; co-ordination and communication between CSOs and between CSOs and the government are improved; the institutional and professional capacities of CSOs are improved",
