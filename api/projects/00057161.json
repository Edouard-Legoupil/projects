Within this context, Suriname will (a) strengthen its systematic, institutional, and human resource capacity to implement SLM; (b) Mainstream policies to support SLM into national development plans; (c) Mobilize resources for the financing of SLM; and (d) adaptive management through participatory processes and dissemination of lessons learned. The GEF alternative will contribute to: (a) increased national awareness of SLM; (b) a National Land-use management system; (c) the completion of the Suriname National Action Plan (through co-financing); (d) improved institutional harmonization and cooperation in the implementation of SLM, and (e) a mid-term financial plan to finance SNAP actions. In addition to baseline actions, GEF support for the amount of $480,795 is requested to complement $947,763 in co-financing. The total value of the GEF increment is $1,428,558.",
