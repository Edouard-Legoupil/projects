This will be important to bring the rationale and urgency for protection in sharper focus, as well as any shortcomings in the management of these MUMAs. The financial and administrative aspects of MUMA management will be reviewed next, including their shortcomings. Finally, PPG funds will be used to develop a monitoring and evaluation (M&E) strategy to track the project\u2019s impacts and to measure biodiversity conservation and financial performance trends over the long term. Based on these results the GEF project proposal will be developed. The project must be designed to satisfy critical needs and bridge critical gaps identified during the Project Preparation phase.",
