This aim will be achieved through building the capacities of the General Organization for Physical Planning (GOPP) by providing training to GOPP staff, regional physical planning centers and local administrations on the use of modern physical planning technologies. The project will address barriers to plan execution, in particular legal and financial matters; and attempts to institutionalize the new physical participatory planning technologies.",
