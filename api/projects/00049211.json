The program has been developed as a follow-up to the \u201cStrengthening Capacities to Combat Corruption in Tanzania\u201d that supported the first phase of NACSAP, 2001-2005. Conceived through an extensive consultative process, the program represents the desire of all actors, including Tanzania\u2019s development partners to sustain the anticorruption momentum generated by the exposure of alleged grand corruption and the Government\u2019s positive responses. Inspired by the Government\u2019s commitment, the SACST seeks, through financial and technical support, to secure and expand the anticorruption effort by strengthening the capacity of national integrity institutions, including PCCB, GGCU and DPP and to support the expansion of NACSAP to include Civil Society, the Private Sector, Local Government Authorities and the core national reform processes.",
