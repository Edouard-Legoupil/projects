Lebanon has recently experienced an important progress in environmental policy and legislation development and application. Several key environmental legislations have been adopted by the parliament since the year 2000 which is a good indicator of the environmental maturity of the country and its efforts towards sustainable development; however, the enforcement of such legislation is what determines whether it has an effective impact on the environment or not.  In Lebanon, the level of enforcement is very limited and almost nonexistent.
