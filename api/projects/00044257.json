Together with international partners, BAPPENAS has undertaken a Damage and Needs assessment which will result in the preparation of an Action Plan for Post-Disaster Recovery. UNDP is already providing technical assistance to BAPPENAS in this respect. As indicated above, UNDP is also leading the \"early recovery\" cluster of the UN emergency response coordination system, with a mandate to support efforts to ensure effective linkages of immediate responses to the earthquake disaster with medium-term recovery (rehabilitation and reconstruction) efforts.",
