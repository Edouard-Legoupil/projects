Coordination and accountability: Many COs are willing to engage on HIV, but they often lack the technical knowledge and network to design a relevant strategy and implementable workplan that are both effective and in line with national needs/priorities. In 2010, 3 COs (oPt, Libya and Iraq) requested that the HIV practice conduct a country mission (several others requested technical support in drafting the strategy, but did not request a country mission).  A  similar number of request for support is expected for 2011 (certain countries already sent a request, cf. Kuwait and UAE), especially for countries for which we managed to leverage PAF grants. LDP and CCE: UNDP committed to take the lead in the UN Joint Teams on AIDS to support leadership development programmes for women, young women and girls living with HIV in 30 countries by end of 2010 , and this was strongly reflected in the UNDP Administrator\u2019s speech on 2 March 2010, during the launch of the UNAIDS Agenda for Accelerated Country action for Women, Girls, Gender Equality and HIV.",
