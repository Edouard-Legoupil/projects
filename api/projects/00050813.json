One of the key requirements for the achievement of the financial sustainability of the water utility companies is to implement economically-based tariffs, i.e. higher water prices. However, in recognition that such measures place a disproportionately greater burden on vulnerable groups, offsetting social mitigation measures (subsidies) will be required. The input received from the engagement of citizens\u2019 groups in the proposed participatory processes will improve municipalities\u2019 ability to target these vulnerable groups, and thereby improve the effectiveness of the social mitigation measures while reducing costs. Furthermore, including citizens\u2019 representatives in the process offers an opportunity to educate the citizenry about the importance of the proposed tariff restructuring, thereby increasing support for such measures at the grassroots level and improving the likelihood of acceptance.",
