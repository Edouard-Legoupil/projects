The project includes training, technical assistance and investment activities. It will also include a National Strategy to address the sector of MDIs (Metered Doses Inhalers). The TPMP will allow the government to phase-out its CFCs consumption by January 2010. Because of the very nature of the project, it is essential to adopt a flexible approach in the implementation phase to allow the government to adapt and adjust the proposed strategy according to its needs.",
