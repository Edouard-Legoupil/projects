The project will develop and replicate/adapt management systems in two \"representative\" communes in the Tazekka-Kroucheen Corridor. The Project Objective is stated as follows: Participatory and multi-functional forest and range management models that ensure forest ecosystem integrity and biodiversity conservation, that improve range productivity and that control erosion are developed in representative priority, forested watersheds in two communes in the Tazekka-Kroucheen Corridor and capacities are built for replicating/adapting them throughout the Corridor and the priority watersheds of the Middle Atlas.","output_id":"00054049","output_title":"Gestion Int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des For\u00eats"}],"project_descr":"Remise en \u00e9tat des fonctions environnementales, int\u00e9grit\u00e9 \u00e9cologique et service socio-\u00e9conomiques des domaines forestiers du Moyen Atlas","project_id":"00045706","project_title":"Gestion Int\u00e9gr\u00e9e des For\u00eats du Moyen Atlas (GIFMA)","region_id":[],"start":"2006-12-06","subnational":[]}
