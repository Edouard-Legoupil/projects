GEF assistance is needed to develop models and to build capacity, for participatory, multi-functional integrated forest ecosystem management. The project will develop and replicate/adapt management systems in two \u201crepresentative\u201d communes in the Tazekka-Kroucheen Corridor. The Project Objective is stated as follows: Participatory and multi-functional forest and range management models that ensure forest ecosystem integrity and biodiversity conservation, that improve range productivity and that control erosion are developed in representative priority, forested watersheds in two communes in the Tazekka-Kroucheen Corridor and capacities are built for replicating/adapting them throughout the Corridor and the priority watersheds of the Middle Atlas.",
