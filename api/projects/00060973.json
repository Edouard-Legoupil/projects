The plan also focuses on the gradual de-institutionalization of residents either by providing families with support to enable the re-integration of beneficiaries or by placing beneficiaries in family-like forms of care, such as small group homes, or provide \u201caccommodation with support\u201d. A number of measures needs to be undertaken to address the many current shortfalls of the Institution, including the lack of standards that define types and quality of services, the lack of capacity of staff, as well as the insufficient budget allocations for staff, services, and assistance to beneficiaries and families.",
